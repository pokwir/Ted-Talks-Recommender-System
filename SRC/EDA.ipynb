       "      <td>Hello, I am Machine Dazzle, and I am an emotionally-driven, instinct-based conceptual artist, designer and musician. Today I&amp;apos;m going to talk about the power of transformation through the sacred ritual of costume. With the help of my friend Matty Crosland. Matty? Oh, hey, girl. (Laughs) Matty is going to hand out a few seeds of possibility while I continue. Growing up in Middle America, I wasn&amp;apos;t allowed to be who I was. I was discouraged from a career in the arts. When we went to the toy store, my two brothers would run to the black and blue aisle and I would run to the pink aisle. There was a lot of shame surrounding my preference for &amp;quot;girls&amp;apos;&amp;quot; toys. I shoplifted my first Barbie. Desperate people do desperate things. But what was really happening during that time is I was building up a massive reserve of ideas, unrealized desires and dreams. And when I bought that one-way ticket to New York, which is the first decision I ever truly made for myself, I brought with me that reserve of unrealized dreams, desires and ideas. And that&amp;apos;s when I really started to take risks. And I learned about the power of transformation, starting with becoming my true self. In 2019, I was commissioned by Guggenheim Works and Process to do a show. I knew immediately that I wanted to make a show about my mother, Deborah. Here she is, printed on my dress. It was the &amp;apos;60s, the bouffant, the cat-eye frames. Maybe some of you remember. Sadly, I lost my mother in 1996 to cancer. So in her honor, I created a rock and roll cabaret. It features songs that I wrote and sang about her, my relationship with her and my self-actualization. It is called &amp;quot;Treasure,&amp;quot; and you can listen to it on your favorite streaming service. In fact, I just released the first dance track from it. It&amp;apos;s called &amp;quot;Understand,&amp;quot; and if you like to wiggle your peach, then you should look it up. (Laughter) My opening outfit, I created this big &amp;apos;60s bouffant. It is made out of about 2,500 metallic pipe cleaners. Why pipe cleaners? Because wigs are common. And I like to challenge existing systems and take risks. And it is actually quite heavy. Transformation takes commitment. Did I mention that my work is maximal? We are complex beings. We exist in many layers. Speaking of layers, then I added this swing coat. It&amp;apos;s made out of an old American flag camouflaged in paint, dye and adorned with flowers. Flowers that I found in the dumpster at the cemetery where my mother&amp;apos;s ashes are buried. Yes, people take fake flowers off of the graves, throw them into the dumpster to put new fake flowers on the graves. I thought it was appropriate. And so there it is, a source of protection. On stage, I became not my mother, that wasn&amp;apos;t the point. I became a higher version of myself. Not man, not woman. Something other. In this show, I&amp;apos;m hoping to realize all of my dreams and not just mine, but all of my mother&amp;apos;s, too, because she had them. More is more. One of my -- yes, I wish you could all have them, but you know how it is. (Laughter) Pom pom on head, look at that. One of my most maximal projects to date is with my favorite collaborator, Taylor Mac. Together with hundreds of others, we created a 24-hour show. It is called &amp;quot;24 Decades: A History of Popular Music.&amp;quot; It premiered in Brooklyn at St. Ann’s Warehouse in 2016. It&amp;apos;s a 24-hour show. It starts in 1776 and goes to the present day. Every hour of the show is dedicated to a different decade in American history. For every decade, I created a costume that is conceptually adjacent, not historically accurate. Why? Because traditional historical costume already exists, conceptually and otherwise. And I like to break traditions and invent new ones. And when you break an egg, there are countless ways to turn it into something delicious. So it’s high noon in Brooklyn at St. Ann’s Warehouse. It&amp;apos;s the top of the show in 1776, right after we freed ourselves from the British in the United States. And inspiration came when I was walking in Brooklyn, where I live. I was passing this laundromat. What were they doing? They were taking down these old, plastic, grand-opening flags. What were they doing? They were putting up new plastic, grand-opening flags. Well, I snatched them out of the garbage because, you know, and I noticed how weather-worn and brittle and fragile they were. And I got to thinking about the end of the American Revolution and how tattered and torn and broken everything must have been. And then it hit me. This costume wants to tell a story. An illegitimate child of colonialism ran away from home to New Orleans and opened the laundromat called Lou Washery, and they are celebrating the Grand Overture as the official, unofficial cheerleader of the original 13 colonies. This is maximalism. Not only is it layer upon layer aesthetically, it&amp;apos;s idea on top of idea conceptually. It becomes its own story, almost that you can almost read like a book. Well, if history has taught us anything, it&amp;apos;s that things change. Here we are an hour later in the show, and it&amp;apos;s time for a costume change. An apple pie as a headdress. The care and the craft and the smell of home. And I put two pipes on Taylor&amp;apos;s back, upholstered in a colonial fabric, steam was coming out of them at the top of that decade. But you know how it is. And they represent the invention of the steam engine, which gave way to westward expansion, for better or for worse. And then I thought, well, what else was happening? Well, George Washington was president at the time, and I was always kind of into his little cherry tree story of virtue. You know, &amp;quot;I cannot tell a lie, I chopped down that cherry tree.&amp;quot; And it was the French Revolution across the pond and the guillotine was like, full on. So I was like, &amp;quot;Well, why don&amp;apos;t I combine them together?&amp;quot; And, oh, you know, severed heads in cherry tree drag as garment. What I&amp;apos;m getting at is, the costume can be so much more than the costume. It can be the props, it can be the set, it can tell its own stories, it can even be its own character. It can be all of it at the same time. This kind of maximalism leaves an audience completely satisfied, yet wanting more at the same time. More is more. Well, wouldn’t you know, now it’s 7pm at night, and it&amp;apos;s time for the Civil War. I took two distinct inventions from this time to help tell this story. I read somewhere once that the American hot dog evolved out of German immigrants selling their bratwurst and rolls on the streets during the 1860s. Well, I like that. And then this distinctive barbed wire, you know, barbed wire, a symbol of separation, security, insecurity. Well, I wanted to combine the two together. In this way of making things, I bring order to disorder. By turning barbed wire into hot dogs, what I&amp;apos;m trying to do, hopefully, is eat through what is separating us, in this case, slavery. When you believe in something that is marginalized and goes against the mainstream of society, it is so important that you do it big, bold, brave and unapologetically, truly. OK, well, here we are after the war again. It’s time for Reconstruction. And, you know, how about the invention of the typewriter? I love the way this piece wiggles as Taylor clicks across the stage. And then the introduction of dynamite and toilet paper on rolls, how domestic! Well, I took those empty toilet paper rolls, and I painted them to look like sticks of dynamite and boom -- headdress, hello. You know, why not? Well, here we are. Now, we&amp;apos;ve been performing all night. We&amp;apos;re tired. It’s 10am. It&amp;apos;s the 1980s. Just in time for the AIDS pandemic. Taylor wears two white, high-heeled shoes sprinkled with little green pom poms. They look like clown shoes, but they represent the white blood cells being attacked by HIV. This collaboration, this &amp;quot;24-Decade History of Popular Music,&amp;quot; took maximalism and &amp;quot;more is more&amp;quot; to a whole new level. I have to say, through the music, the storytelling and the transformative nature of the costumes, we changed the course of queer history. And if nothing else, it sure is fun to pull an all-nighter with 24 costume changes. Well, here we are. This is an image of me on the streets of New York City at the Easter Bonnet Parade several years ago. I am a fan of taking my art to the streets. But I have to tell you, it takes a little bit of courage to dress like this in public, particularly these days. Just about every part of my creative ethos is under attack in the United States right now. On first glance, you might see an over-the-top outfit on a Sunday, in black and white and pink. But upon closer inspection, you&amp;apos;ll see the details, the skull peeking out, the skeletal hand creeping out of the innocent plush animals on my head. I once had my Easter bonnet ripped right off of my head in front of St. Patrick&amp;apos;s Cathedral. Not this one. I don&amp;apos;t think they would dare. Sometimes, I think that life is about overcoming all of your greatest fears. Life itself is how you go about that. I go all the way. I do the work. There is no happiness that I know unless I am risking something. The only true happiness that I know comes from this sense of accomplishment, by taking the risk. Well, here I am again on the streets of New York, this time for the Reclaim Pride March back in 2019 again. A good friend gave me really good advice once. &amp;quot;Machine, it&amp;apos;s never too early to be pre-revolutionary, and it&amp;apos;s never too late to be post-apocalyptic chic.&amp;quot; (Laughter) Sometimes this course of action, this transformation, is the most honest action that you can take. You owe yourself honesty. I consider it a prayer. Today, after all, is a placeholder for what&amp;apos;s coming tomorrow. By becoming other, you avoid labels. You can change someone&amp;apos;s life just by walking across the room because you are changing what is possible in their minds. Be more. You will get more out of life. And not just for you, for everyone around you. I&amp;apos;m telling you, that is the Gospel truth. Another thing I wanted to say, this collective land of make-believe that we are in right now, this is very fertile, very creative space where anything is possible. Matty, let&amp;apos;s bring it home.

       "      <td>Can you paint with all the colors of the wind? I love this song from the first time I heard it. I was 14, growing up in public housing in western Sydney. So maybe a little too old for this Disney classic from &amp;quot;Pocahontas.&amp;quot; But it spoke to me. I saw something of myself in it. At this stage, I think I knew I was queer. I mean, come on, I was rocking out to Disney. (Laughter) And look at those glasses. (Laughter) Seriously, what a queer kid. (Laughter) But I was also from a Pacific Indigenous heritage with conservative views and values. I didn&amp;apos;t feel like I could fit into any of the boxes that were being presented to me. Straight, gay, Fijian, Australian. I couldn&amp;apos;t pick just one color to paint with. Prior to colonization, sexuality amongst many of our Pacific islands across the region was fluid. Men would have sex with men without the stigma or shame afforded it today. Sexual intimacy was a way of being able to connect socially and relationally. Sex wasn&amp;apos;t just for procreation. Or in marriage. It wasn&amp;apos;t exclusively monogamous. Just because you had sex with a man didn&amp;apos;t define your sexuality. It didn&amp;apos;t make you an outcast. But as Europeans started to colonize the Pacific region, they brought Christian missionaries with them. They told us to cover up our beautiful bodies. We were taught shame. We were told to stop practicing Pacifica cultures and values that were seen as provocative. To a Western and white perspective, our non-binary sexuality was judged as tribal, outdated, sinful and impossible to practice alongside a Christian faith. Still today, those who are Indigenous to the Pacific are negatively impacted by whiteness. That “white is right, West is best.” I was brought up to espouse strong Christian beliefs, views and values which would shape my burgeoning identity as an adult. From these staunch conservative views, I was taught to fear the queer. Those people that were seen as unusual and fruity. And in essence, I grew to despise a part of myself. I sought to separate my queerness from my identity. I could never see myself as part of that world. Growing up, biracial and bisexual constantly challenged the way I saw the world around me. I was unsure about my thinking, feelings and behaviors around liking males and females. I was unsure about my thinking, feelings and behaviors when it came to whether I needed to be a white Australian or a Fijian person. And whether this needed to be framed within a binary to choose one over the other. In this way, I don&amp;apos;t think that my story is unique. There&amp;apos;s plenty of people in the queer world that have escaped conservative upbringings, religions and cultures. But this is only part of my story. Another common story in the queer community is the coming-out story. When did you tell your parents? How did they react? How it liberated you or ultimately separated you from your family. But this didn&amp;apos;t feel like an option for me either. I believe that embedded in these particular stories, these tropes, is a part of dominant queer culture that made it very hard for me to access the queer world. For example, when I started to go to gay clubs, I would be lining up at the front of the club and often I would get door staff come up to me and go, &amp;quot;Sorry, you do know this is a gay club, right?&amp;quot; From these lived experiences, I feel that there is a whiteness that pervades queer culture. And I didn&amp;apos;t want to give up my identity and my appearance as a Pacific indigenous person to be queer. Pacifica cultures really, really value and esteem the collective above the individual. For Pacifica people, our families are inextricably connected to our own sense of self-agency, self-determination, self-esteem, self-love and self-worth. Our own individual identities are meshed and intertwined with our family&amp;apos;s reputation and standing in the community. Our mind, body and souls are inextricably connected to the broader community, to our families, to ourselves and to others. I didn&amp;apos;t want to come out to potentially ostracize myself, to make a point to separate myself from my Pacific and faith communities. I couldn&amp;apos;t then see my authentic self in any of these spaces. And a quick shout out to my son on the left-hand side. Round of applause for my son. (Laughs) (Applause) He said to me this morning, &amp;quot;Daddy, make sure you mention me.&amp;quot; So I was like, &amp;quot;OK, son. Alright.&amp;quot; So there you go for the recording, son. And the rest are my other family, that&amp;apos;s up there as well. Across queer cultures and the broader community, we have learned to embrace our gender and sexual differences. We encourage individuals to be allies for each other and to support safe spaces for those that are seen to not fit in. We empower and really encourage individuals to really develop and express their self-agency, their self-determination, their self love, their self-worth. We boldly go into spaces striving to bring others with us to ensure that we can create inclusive societies for everyone. However, the dominant Western view in queer cultures is still based on the individual. Me, myself and I. And my individual pursuits towards happiness. As a queer Indigenous Pacific person, I feel that there are parts of queer culture that is white, feels very white. We may fail to see the importance of bringing our families and our cultural communities along our journey as queer people. It&amp;apos;s either the queer way or the highway. It&amp;apos;s one or the other. Young or old. Rich or poor. Smart or stupid. Masculine or feminine. Fit or fat. These binaries create a sense of us and them, those people. A binary approach and position that we generally in Western white societies use to determine the norm. We create, conflate, perpetuate binaries that create divisions in our society. Saints or sinner, straight or gay. I see it like this. Binaries are a very white and Western way of thinking, feeling and behaving. As individuals today, we live within these binaries and create identities that then create these labels. We use these labels to then define and confine people and places. We are one or the other. But what we fail to see is that our identities are more than a set of binaries. Our own identities are comprised of intersecting identifiers that contributes to who you are, including our age, class, color, education, gender, size, spirituality, sexuality, and so, so much more. We need to decolonize queerness, to live beyond “white is right, West is best.” Because if we don&amp;apos;t, we&amp;apos;re going to continue to create silos and divisions in our societies that don&amp;apos;t create inclusive and safe spaces for everyone. For Indigenous queer people, they shape our connection to community and culture, our families. If we don&amp;apos;t include that within our understanding of who we are, even as queer people, then we&amp;apos;re not able to be, again, our true and authentic selves. We&amp;apos;re not able to then be our fabulous selves as part of the queer community. And it&amp;apos;s really, really interesting because I believe that we can learn so much from pre-colonial cultures like those that were practiced in the Pacific, that provide a different way of looking at a society. A queer way that pre-dates all the privileges that go into binary ways of thinking, feeling and behaving. Across many of our Pacifica languages we have a lot of key concepts that help solidify and support a shared understanding of the collective. For example, in Fijian, &amp;quot;solesolevaki&amp;quot; is all about reciprocal living, where my wellbeing is your wellbeing. I will actively seek to ensure that your well-being and every part of your life is catered for, knowing that you will do the same for me. We strive to enact “veiqaravi,” as tatted here on my hand, to serve others. We strive to also embed and embold and empower people to practice &amp;quot;veirokovi,&amp;quot; respect for self and others where we are relationally driven, where that is so important to our spaces and places. My sense of ability to actually put this into practice, my ability to actually understand these Indigenous perspectives has greatly helped shape and reconcile my queer identity today. But what&amp;apos;s really interesting is that it&amp;apos;s not just queer communities that need to decolonize itself. It&amp;apos;s all of us as a broader society that needs to be part of a shared conversation to decolonize, deconstruct and disrupt binary ways of thinking, feeling and behaving. So how can we practically do that? Practice cultural humility, where you are constantly learning and embracing differences, where you get over yourselves and strive to learn about other people&amp;apos;s differences and how that can be meaningfully included in the way in which you create safe spaces for everyone. I also believe it&amp;apos;s possible to bring Indigenous perspectives into Western and white workplaces. For example, I’ve introduced the concept of “talanoa” in all of my work meetings. Talanoa is all about being able to create a safe space where everyone is able to contribute to a collective, collegial and collaborative conversation. Where people are able to bring their authentic selves into these spaces. Literally, I will chair meetings where I have no firm set agenda items and I literally would just hold space for participants just to bring themselves. So you can tell I&amp;apos;m a social worker, right? (Laughter) Safe space, safe space, safe space. It&amp;apos;s OK, it&amp;apos;s OK. But it&amp;apos;s through these safe spaces that people can bring their multiple, intersecting identifiers, including their age, their class, color, education, gender, size, spirituality, sexuality and so, so much more. I invite queer communities to come talanoa with Pacific Indigenous Communities to create robust and resilient queer cultures. I have been able to greatly reconcile my queer and Pacifica identities, which has now really been embraced to help shape how I see the world around me today. And it&amp;apos;s through these shared perspectives and approaches that we can truly embrace cultural diversity and its differences. And to know that people can live beyond those binaries and those labels we continue to perpetuate and perpetrate against others. It is a commitment from queer communities to decolonize queerness. It&amp;apos;s a commitment from me, from you and all of us to decolonize Western and white societies and to live beyond the binary way of thinking, feeling and behaving. I genuinely believe that it&amp;apos;s through this common goal that we can truly learn how to paint with all the colors of the wind. “Vinaka vakalevu” and thank you.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I spent my whole career in the nonprofit sector. Street outreach, program management, fundraising, grant making, public policy, you name it, I&amp;apos;ve done it. I&amp;apos;ve seen a lot. And I&amp;apos;m a really positive person, so it&amp;apos;s actually difficult to say this. But the way we do philanthropy right now, the way we&amp;apos;ve done it for decades, is broken. And here&amp;apos;s how I found out. In my early 20s, I was a frontline social worker in New York City, working with people living with HIV. Many of them had multiple chronic illnesses, and they were underhoused. So I&amp;apos;d spend my days, and even some nights, with them, running around the city to doctor&amp;apos;s appointments and housing agencies. The day-to-day work was hard. But the hardest part was we never had had enough funding to do the work. On Friday mornings, I&amp;apos;d go into the office to write up my case notes for the week and I&amp;apos;d speed past front reception, not looking at the mailboxes full of blue slips. Each blue letter marked another colleague let go because of our funding crisis. Within one month, I’d lost half my team, and my caseload ballooned from 30 to over 100. And this is the reality for so many nonprofits. They&amp;apos;re at the mercy of their funders. And when we look at those funders, they decide who and what gets funded. And it&amp;apos;s almost always a mystery how they make those decisions. Nonprofits spend so much time fundraising, filling out pages and pages and pages of paperwork. And they&amp;apos;re filling out so much paperwork that they hardly have any time to actually support communities, which is literally the thing that they&amp;apos;re funded to do. After years of doing amazing work, improving every single metric, we&amp;apos;d hear things like, &amp;quot;I&amp;apos;m sorry, our major donor has switched direction. They’re no longer working and investing in HIV and AIDS.” Or, “I’m sorry, we issue grants for three years max.&amp;quot; This would never happen in the private sector. You do an amazing job for three years and then get fired? It makes no sense. So I decided to switch sides. Instead of being on the side that&amp;apos;s asking for money, what if I went to the side that was giving money? Help them understand what was happening on the ground and make a change. So off I went into the world of philanthropy only to discover that trillions of dollars are in donor-advised funds and private foundations just waiting to be donated. Meanwhile, those nonprofits and community-led organizations are wasting so much time filling out paperwork and competing over scraps. I&amp;apos;d hear a donor publicly support a cause like homelessness. And then behind closed doors, I&amp;apos;d hear, &amp;quot;They don&amp;apos;t really know what&amp;apos;s good for them. What they really need is ...&amp;quot; Which is code for “donor knows best.” I was confused. How could a donor possibly know what was really needed? Their lifestyle look nothing like the people they wanted to help. The problem wasn&amp;apos;t a lack of money. Again, trillions of dollars are sitting just waiting to be put to work. But even if we unlocked every single one of those dollars, it actually wouldn&amp;apos;t matter because a very small group of people are making all of the decisions about funding. Their priorities, their way. Almost 70 percent of donations are directed by the top one percent of donors. And they choose causes that resonate with their lives, like their university or the arts. And these issues are overfunded. And look, I know that donors have good intentions. I really do. But good intentions are not good enough. Communities are being left behind, and we are running out of time. I wanted to shift the power dynamic from a top-down approach to a community-led model, where nonprofits and donors really work together. So in 2020, I co-founded the Foundation for Black Communities with Liban Abokor, Djaka Blais-Amare and Joseph Smith, to do exactly that. We were inspired by a radically different type of philanthropy, Black philanthropy. It&amp;apos;s the formal and informal giving that happens in Black communities around the world. In some cases, it&amp;apos;s the kind of giving that you don&amp;apos;t get a tax receipt for. And I learned this mostly in my family. We do almost everything together, including box hand. Box hand is an informal savings group, and in my family we have 13 members. So twice a month we all throw a hand, meaning we put 100 dollars into the pot and one person gets the entire thing, 1,300 dollars. The person who gets the full amount rotates, and you&amp;apos;ll get the full thing two times a year. It&amp;apos;s helped my family buy a new fridge, pay school tuition, and you know what, we&amp;apos;ve even put a down payment on a house using this. And sometimes we negotiate. &amp;quot;Oh, you need your hand ahead of me? No problem, I&amp;apos;ll wait.&amp;quot; Of the 13 people, some really need it. It&amp;apos;s their only means of savings. And others would be fine without it. But here, we&amp;apos;re all equal. There is no top or bottom. It&amp;apos;s not about charity or pity or sympathy. The goal of box hand is that everybody levels up. And it’s easier to level up together because we&amp;apos;re accountable to the collective. This practice has existed across the African diaspora since the 1700s. In Guyana, we call it box hand. In Nigeria, its “susu.” In Mali and Senegal it’s “tontines.” In Haiti, it’s called “sol.” And in Jamaica, it’s “partner.” And the cool thing is this exists outside of the African diaspora, too. It looks slightly different from place to place. The Haida nation has potlatches, in Mexico, there&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;tandas&amp;quot; and in Cambodia, there&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;tontine.&amp;quot; And communities turn to each other and use this kind of collective approach when we face exclusion and systemic racism in the financial industry. For example, Black people are rejected business loans and mortgages at twice the rate of the general population. And so when we face that exclusion, we turn to our communities and are creative in our solution-making. And, you know, this has been passed down from generation to generation. My mother taught me this. She gives generously to our communities because they gave generously to her. Now and forever, the collective giving never stops. Black philanthropy is rooted in a concept called Ubuntu. It&amp;apos;s an African philosophy widely understood as humanity towards others. And we have a saying: “I am because you are.” Or &amp;quot;I am because we are.&amp;quot; And that means, what affects you affects me. We&amp;apos;re all interconnected and have a shared responsibility to one another. Ubuntu would be the guiding principle for the Foundation for Black Communities. And in order to do that, we need to make two practical shifts. Who is making funding decisions, and how those decisions are made? So the who is obvious. We&amp;apos;re looking at Black community members, but we&amp;apos;re looking for true, on-the-ground experts. And this is an important distinction. Some people will say to me, &amp;quot;Rebecca, you&amp;apos;re Black. Tell us what&amp;apos;s best for Black communities,&amp;quot; which is actually ridiculous. How could I possibly speak on behalf of all Black people? You can&amp;apos;t, it&amp;apos;s not possible. So to have real insight, we’d look for local experts and let them make the decisions. Because they know their communities, their partners and field the best. And this is what we did in our recent, 500,000-dollar youth wellness granting program. We received 99 eligible applications from Black groups working in everything from diabetes awareness to inner-city farming and after school programming. And just like box hand, we turn to the collective and extended an invitation to be part of our grant review panel. Now, the invitation was intentionally put to anybody connected to the project. It might be a program manager, a participant or a volunteer. And those volunteers became peer reviewers. The peer reviewers read each application, scored them and offered candid feedback. And then we used their rankings to allocate funding. In other words, it was the collective that made the funding decision. Now, you might be thinking, &amp;quot;What&amp;apos;s the big deal about that?&amp;quot; But after years in philanthropy, I can tell you, that&amp;apos;s not how it&amp;apos;s typically done. It&amp;apos;s usually the donor, maybe their relative or a CEO who has the final say. But here, we trusted community to do the work and to make those funding decisions. Luckily, we&amp;apos;re not the first or only to pool funding and trust community to make decisions. We&amp;apos;re part of a growing movement that&amp;apos;s changing the power dynamics in philanthropy. And recently, because of our community-led approach and collective advocacy, the Canadian government awarded the Foundation for Black Communities a historic 200 million dollars. (Cheers and applause) This is amazing. And I&amp;apos;m hopeful that private foundations and donors will follow this powerful example. You know, there are hundreds of community-led collaboratives working in the most pressing issues of our times. For example, there’s Right Relations Collaborative, and Indigenous peoples are making the decisions there. At the Equality Fund, feminists are making the decisions. And at CLIMA Fund, climate activists are making the decisions. When I think back on my time in the front lines, I wonder, if different people were making the funding decisions would those blue slips even have existed? Because the funding was always available. It just wasn&amp;apos;t accessible to the communities who need it most. And this is finally changing with community-led collaborative funds. Even after all of my time in the sector, the highs and lows, I&amp;apos;m optimistic, because the future of philanthropy is happening right now, where community-led collaboratives are the bridge between people who want to do good with their money and the people on the ground with the experience to do it. This is Ubuntu. We are all interconnected, and each of us has a role to play. I am because you are. I am because we are. Thank you. (Applause and cheers)</td>\n",

       "      <td>I became obsessed with the relationship between the brain and the mind after suffering a series of concussions playing football and rugby in college. I felt my mind change for years after. I was studying computers at the time, and it felt as though I had damaged my hardware and that my software was running differently. Over the following years, a close friend suffered a serious neck injury and multiple friends and family members were struggling with crippling mental health issues. All around me, people that I loved dearly were being afflicted by ailments of the nervous system or the mind. I was grappling with all of this while pursuing an MFA in Design and Technology at Parsons when a friend and fellow student showed me an open-source tutorial on how to build a low-cost single-channel EEG system to detect brain activity. After a couple long nights of hacking and tinkering, I saw my brainwaves dancing across the screen for the very first time. And that moment changed my life. In that moment, I felt as though I had the possibility to help myself and the people I loved. And I also realized that I couldn&amp;apos;t do it alone. I needed help. So in 2013, in Brooklyn, with some like-minded friends, I started OpenBCI, an open-source neurotechnology company. In the beginning, our goal was to build an inward-pointing telescope and to share the blueprints with the world so that anybody with a computer could begin peering into their own brain. At first, we were an EEG-only company. We sold brain sensors to measure brain activity. I thought that&amp;apos;s what people wanted. But over time, we discovered people doing very strange things with our technology. Some people were connecting the equipment to the stomach to measure the neurons in the gut and study gut-brain connection and the microbiome. Others were using the tools to build new muscle sensors and controllers for prosthetics and robotics. And some were designing new devices and peripheral add-ons that could be connected to the platform to measure new types of data that I had never heard of before. What we learned from all of this is that the brain by itself is actually quite boring. Turns out brain data alone lacks context. And what we ultimately care about is not the brain, but the mind, consciousness, human cognition. When we have things like EMG sensors to measure muscle activity or ECG sensors to measure heart activity, eye trackers and even environmental sensors to measure the world around us, all of this makes the brain data much more useful. But the organs around our body, our sensory receptors, are actually much easier to collect data from than the brain, and also arguably much more important for determining the things that we actually care about: emotions, intentions and the mind overall. Additionally, we realized that people weren&amp;apos;t just interested in reading from the brain and the body. They were also interested in modulating the mind through various types of sensory stimulation. Things like light, sound, haptics and electricity. It&amp;apos;s one thing to record the mind, it&amp;apos;s another to modulate it. The idea of a combined system that can both read from and write to the brain or body is referred to as a closed-loop system or bidirectional human interface. This concept is truly profound, and it will define the next major revolution in computing technology. When you have products that not just are designed for the average user but are designed to actually adapt to their user, that&amp;apos;s something truly special. When we know what the data of an emotion or a feeling looks like and we know how to make that data go up or down, then using AI, we can build constructive or destructive interference patterns to either amplify or suppress those emotions or feelings. In the very near future, we will have computers that we are resonantly and subconsciously connected to, enabling empathetic computing for the very first time. In 2018, we put these learnings to work and began development of a new tool for cognitive exploration. Named after my friend Gael, who passed from ALS in 2016, we call it Galea. It’s a multimodal bio-sensing headset, and it is absolutely packed with sensors. It can measure the user’s heart, skin, muscles, eyes and brain, and it combines that capability with head-mounted displays or augmented and virtual reality headsets. Additionally, we&amp;apos;re exploring the integration of non-invasive electrical neural stimulation as a feature. The Galea software suite can turn the raw sensor data into meaningful metrics. With some of the sensors, we&amp;apos;re able to provide new forms of real-time interactivity and control. And with all of the sensors, we&amp;apos;re able to make quantifiable inferences about high-level states of mind, things like stress, fatigue, cognitive workload and focus. In 2019, a legendary neurohacker by the name of Christian Bayerlein reached out to me. He was actually one of our very first Kickstarter backers when we got started, early on. Christian was a very smart, intelligent, happy-go-lucky and easygoing guy. And so I worked up the courage to ask him, &amp;quot;Hey, Christian, can we connect you to our sensors?&amp;quot; At which point he said, &amp;quot;I thought you would never ask.&amp;quot; (Laughter) So after 20 minutes, we had him rigged up to a bunch of electrodes, and we provided him with four new inputs to a computer. Little digital buttons, that he could control voluntarily. This essentially doubled his number of inputs to a computer. Years later, after many setbacks due to COVID, we flew to Germany to work with Christian in person to implement the first prototype of what we&amp;apos;re going to be demoing here today. Christian then spent months training with that prototype and sending his data across the Atlantic to us in Brooklyn from Germany and flying a virtual drone in our offices. The first thing that we did was scour Christian&amp;apos;s body for residual motor function. We then connected electrodes to the four muscles that he had the most voluntary control over, and then we turned those muscles into digital buttons. We then applied some smart filtering and signal processing to adapt those buttons into something more like a slider or a digital potentiometer. After that, we turned those four sliders and mapped them to a new virtual joystick. Christian then combined that new joystick with the joystick that he uses with his lip to control his wheelchair, and with the two joysticks combined, Christian finally had control over all the manual controls of a drone. I’m going to stop talking about it, and we’re going to show you. Christian, welcome. (Applause) At this point, I&amp;apos;m going to ask everybody to turn off your Bluetooth and put your phones in airplane mode so that you don&amp;apos;t get hit in the face with a drone. (Laughter) How are you feeling, Christian? Christian Bayerlein: Yeah, let&amp;apos;s do it. Conor Russomanno: Awesome. This is a heads-up display that&amp;apos;s showing all of Christian&amp;apos;s biometric data, as well as some information about the drone. On the left here, we can see Christian&amp;apos;s muscle data. Christian is now going to attempt to fly the drone. How are you feeling, Christian, feeling good? CB: Yes. CR: All right. Rock and roll. Let&amp;apos;s take this up for a joyride. Whenever you&amp;apos;re ready. CB: I&amp;apos;m ready. (Applause and cheers) CR: All right, take her up. And now let&amp;apos;s do something we probably shouldn&amp;apos;t do and fly it over the audience. (Laughter) (Cheers and applause) Alright, actually, let’s do this. I&amp;apos;m going to ask for people to call out some commands in the audience. So how about you? Straight forward. Straight forward. (Laughter) Alright. How about you? Man: Up! (Laughter) CR: Not down. Oh, he&amp;apos;s doing what he wants right now. Amazing. (Cheers and applause) Alright, let’s bring it back. And what I&amp;apos;m going to do right now is take control of the controller so that you guys know that there isn&amp;apos;t someone backstage flying this drone. All right, Christian, you&amp;apos;re alright with that? CB: Yeah. CR: Unplug. Forward. And we&amp;apos;re going to land this guy now. CB: I think I was better than you. (Laughter) (Applause) CR: Amazing. (Applause) Now I&amp;apos;m going to unplug it so it doesn&amp;apos;t turn on on its own. Perfect. Christian has repurposed dormant muscles from around his body for extended and augmented interactivity. We have turned those muscles into a generic controller that in this case we&amp;apos;ve mapped into a drone, but what&amp;apos;s really cool is that joystick can be applied to anything. Another thing that&amp;apos;s really cool is that even in individuals who are not living with motor disabilities, there exist dozens of dormant muscles around the body that we can tap into for augmented and expanded control interactivity. And lastly, all the code related to that virtual joystick, we&amp;apos;re going to open source so that you can implement it and improve upon it. There&amp;apos;s three things that have stood out to me from working on this project and many others over the years. One, we cannot conflate the brain with the mind. In order to understand emotions and tensions and the mind overall, we have to measure data from all over the body, not just the brain. Two, open-source technology access and literacy is one way that we can combat the potential ethical challenges we face in introducing neural technology to society. But that&amp;apos;s not enough. We have to do much, much more than that. It&amp;apos;s very important, imperative, that we set up guardrails and design the future that we want to live in. Three. It&amp;apos;s the courage and resilience of trailblazers like Christian who don&amp;apos;t get bogged down by what they can&amp;apos;t do, but instead strive to prove that the impossible is in fact possible. (Applause) And since none of this would have been possible without you, Christian, the stage is yours. CB: Yeah, hi, everybody. Audience: Hi. CB: I&amp;apos;m excited to be here today. I was born with a genetic condition that affects my mobility and requires me to have assistance. Despite my disability, I&amp;apos;m a very happy and fulfilled person. What truly holds me back are not my physical limitations. It&amp;apos;s rather the barriers in the environment. I&amp;apos;m a tech nerd and political activist. I believe that technology can empower disabled people. It can help create a better, more inclusive and accessible world for everyone. This demonstration is a perfect example. We saw what&amp;apos;s possible when cutting edge technology is combined with human curiosity and creativity. So let&amp;apos;s build tools that empower people, applications that break down barriers and systems that unlock a world of possibilities. I think that&amp;apos;s an idea worth spreading. Thank you.

Well, when I was a little girl, whenever I was asked the question, my answer was pretty much always the same: &amp;quot;When I grow up, I want to become a man.&amp;quot; To my logic, that was the only way I could live a life free from the suffocating restrictions that women in my birth country of Iran were forced to endure. I&amp;apos;m not quite sure where this line of thinking started from, but a particularly hot summer&amp;apos;s afternoon comes to mind. I was nine years old and along with my family, as we did on every summer holiday, we had traveled to the north of Iran to a little seaside village called Chamkhaleh. For as long as I remember, some of my best childhood memories are of me swimming in the Caspian Sea, paddling in its waves and making sandcastles on its gorgeous beaches. All of those lovely memories, though, were about to be rewritten. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, when a girl turns nine years old, she has legally entered womanhood. And that means having to follow a series of restrictive rules written by men. The most symbolic of which is probably the mandatory wearing of the hijab. That year, my mom had to sit me down and sorrowfully explain that I was now too old to get into the water wearing a swimsuit. Now that I was nine years old, it was illegal. And if I wanted to get into the water like all the other women, I had to go in fully covered from head to toe. I had to go in wearing a pair of trousers, a long-sleeved top and a loose covering called the manto to cover it all. And of course, the headscarf. I still remember the lump in my throat as I set foot in the water. I could no longer feel the fresh coolness of the Caspian Sea against my skin. Instead, my now-wet layers felt itchy and weird. I can still remember feeling the watchful eyes of the morality police, the so-called morality police, making sure that me and the other girls were not showing too much hair or too much skin to, God forbid, arouse the men. It was as if my former freedoms were washing away with every tide and flow of the water. Next, I&amp;apos;m deep in the water. I was a good swimmer, but my layers were so heavy and restrictive. I tried to gasp for air, but my headscarf kept blocking my face. The tides were pulling me further and further out. I could see my mom and dad on the beach, I tried to call for help, but they couldn&amp;apos;t hear me. Perhaps my voice was drowned out by the roaring engines of the bikes that the morality police were patrolling the beaches. The tides continued, pulling me further and further out and hopelessness started creeping in. Next, I wake up on the beach, cold, wet, shivering. It turns out my father had just spotted my struggles in time and had rushed in to get me. That was the last time I ever set foot in my beloved Caspian Sea. Growing up in the Islamic Republic of Iran, every day it felt as though I was going through the same experience but in different ways. And looking at the women in my life, they seemed to be going through the same thing too, in different ways. And the older I grew, the further out the tides of oppression, injustice, inequality felt like they were pulling me in. Wherever I turned, shame, fear and especially hopelessness were ever-present. Women in Iran are second-class citizens. They have almost no access when it comes to some of the most basic rights like divorce, custody of children and even travel. They have no legal protection against sexual harassment and domestic violence. They are not allowed to sing in public or have sex outside of marriage, and they&amp;apos;re only allowed to show their face and hand in public. In the 20 years or so since I almost drowned, nothing has changed. Iranian women have been adrift in a vast sea of oppression. Their only way out, for those who could, is to leave themselves at the mercy of people smugglers, set out on dangerous journeys in hope of finding safety in a land far away. That&amp;apos;s what happened to me. Age 12, along with my mom and my baby sister, we escaped Iran. And after years of living in refugee camps across Europe, sleeping rough and being at the mercy of some very, very dodgy people smugglers, we finally found safe haven here, in the UK. For my friends and family who stayed behind, there was little hope for change. And so when in September last year, 22-year-old Mahsa Jina Amini stepped out of the metro onto the bustling streets of Tehran, there was little reason to expect a change to the status quo. The same way that it&amp;apos;s happened to my own mother and many other women I know, Mahsa was arrested by the so-called morality police because, in their opinion, she was showing more hair than they deemed acceptable. Three days later, Mahsa died in police custody. This time, though, something changed. Thanks to the power of social media and the brave journalists working hard on the ground, the news of Mahsa&amp;apos;s killing wasn&amp;apos;t drowned out in the regime&amp;apos;s relentless propaganda. In the same way that the unjust killing of George Floyd ignited the Black Lives Matter movement, the unjust killing of Mahsa Amini ignited the biggest anti-regime protests across Iran since the formation of the Islamic Republic in 1979. For the first time in decades, women in Iran are finally daring to defy the strict morality laws. In a fight for equality and dignity, they are taking off their headscarves, burning them in bonfires, and some are cutting off their hair. They&amp;apos;re chanting &amp;quot;Zan. Zendegi. Azadi.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Woman, Life, Freedom.&amp;quot; Furious crowds are calling for democracy, for freedom of speech, for freedom of expression, whilst many others are calling for the fall of the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Khamenei is Iran&amp;apos;s spiritual leader and has the final say over all government matters. For the first time in a very, very long time, there seems to be hope in the air. Hope that perhaps change in Iran is possible. And that&amp;apos;s exactly why the crackdown has been so brutal and deadly. These are the faces of the protesters who fought for freedom but will not live to see it. Since the protest began nearly five months ago, around 500 people have been killed. Nearly 80 of those children. Around 18,000 protesters have been arrested. And there are reports of psychological, physical and sexual torture in prisons. There has been a series of hasty trials, forced confessions and public executions of the protesters. The authoritarian regime of Iran is clearly desperate to kill any and all hope because they know that for as long as we remain hopeless, we&amp;apos;ll resign to their oppression and injustice. But as history has shown over and over again, the light of hope emerges from the depth of darkness. Hope is angry. It&amp;apos;s defiant. Hope is dangerous. Hope is standing its ground on the streets of Iran, chanting &amp;quot;Woman, Life, Freedom.&amp;quot; Hope is in political prisons, biding its time, sustaining those in shackles. Hope has now spread to the four corners of my birth country. As a journalist, I can&amp;apos;t travel to Iran. But as my sisters in Tehran, Mashhad, Shiraz, Baluchistan, Kurdistan, shomal, jonoob, shargh, gharb, all over Iran have done, I, too, I&amp;apos;m going to cut my hair to show my solidarity with the movement. (Cheers and applause) (Cheers and applause continues) Thank you. (Applause continues) (Applause ends) Thank you. Audience: Freedom for women! (Cheers) SZ: This hair, for too long, has been intertwined with religion and politics. But I say with my sisters in Iran: no more. And I say with them: Women, to reclaim our rights. (Applause and cheers) Life, for the lives unjustly taken. (Applause) Freedom, for the liberation of my people. (Applause) I stand here with my hair in my hand, in hope of a future where no little girl has to wish she were a man because she&amp;apos;s terrified that she might drown every day. (Applause) Yes, the crackdown is brutal. And yes, there might not be a solution inside yet. But the only thing that can help create and sustain one is hope. Sorry. (Cheers and applause) The only thing that can help create and sustain one is hope. And every single one of us can take a step and play our part. I&amp;apos;m standing here speaking to you now. Many non-Iranians and Iranians outside of Iran have been signing petitions, going to protest, putting pressure on their governments so that in turn, they put pressure on the Iranian regime and government. For the past few months, I&amp;apos;ve been speaking to protesters inside of Iran, and they tell me how much it matters to them that we on the outside stay informed and engaged. So let&amp;apos;s try our best to make certain that those of us on the shore let those at sea know that we see them, that we hear their cries. Thank you for taking a step towards a future where freedom is not just a dream, but a reality. Not just for women, but for everyone. And not just in Iran, but everywhere. Thank you.

       "0  Hello, I am Machine Dazzle, and I am an emotionally-driven, instinct-based conceptual artist, designer and musician. Today I&apos;m going to talk about the power of transformation through the sacred ritual of costume. With the help of my friend Matty Crosland. Matty? Oh, hey, girl. (Laughs) Matty is going to hand out a few seeds of possibility while I continue. Growing up in Middle America, I wasn&apos;t allowed to be who I was. I was discouraged from a career in the arts. When we went to the toy store, my two brothers would run to the black and blue aisle and I would run to the pink aisle. There was a lot of shame surrounding my preference for &quot;girls&apos;&quot; toys. I shoplifted my first Barbie. Desperate people do desperate things. But what was really happening during that time is I was building up a massive reserve of ideas, unrealized desires and dreams. And when I bought that one-way ticket to New York, which is the first decision I ever truly made for myself, I brought with me that reserve of unrealized dreams, desires and ideas. And that&apos;s when I really started to take risks. And I learned about the power of transformation, starting with becoming my true self. In 2019, I was commissioned by Guggenheim Works and Process to do a show. I knew immediately that I wanted to make a show about my mother, Deborah. Here she is, printed on my dress. It was the &apos;60s, the bouffant, the cat-eye frames. Maybe some of you remember. Sadly, I lost my mother in 1996 to cancer. So in her honor, I created a rock and roll cabaret. It features songs that I wrote and sang about her, my relationship with her and my self-actualization. It is called &quot;Treasure,&quot; and you can listen to it on your favorite streaming service. In fact, I just released the first dance track from it. It&apos;s called &quot;Understand,&quot; and if you like to wiggle your peach, then you should look it up. (Laughter) My opening outfit, I created this big &apos;60s bouffant. It is made out of about 2,500 metallic pipe cleaners. Why pipe cleaners? Because wigs are common. And I like to challenge existing systems and take risks. And it is actually quite heavy. Transformation takes commitment. Did I mention that my work is maximal? We are complex beings. We exist in many layers. Speaking of layers, then I added this swing coat. It&apos;s made out of an old American flag camouflaged in paint, dye and adorned with flowers. Flowers that I found in the dumpster at the cemetery where my mother&apos;s ashes are buried. Yes, people take fake flowers off of the graves, throw them into the dumpster to put new fake flowers on the graves. I thought it was appropriate. And so there it is, a source of protection. On stage, I became not my mother, that wasn&apos;t the point. I became a higher version of myself. Not man, not woman. Something other. In this show, I&apos;m hoping to realize all of my dreams and not just mine, but all of my mother&apos;s, too, because she had them. More is more. One of my -- yes, I wish you could all have them, but you know how it is. (Laughter) Pom pom on head, look at that. One of my most maximal projects to date is with my favorite collaborator, Taylor Mac. Together with hundreds of others, we created a 24-hour show. It is called &quot;24 Decades: A History of Popular Music.&quot; It premiered in Brooklyn at St. Ann’s Warehouse in 2016. It&apos;s a 24-hour show. It starts in 1776 and goes to the present day. Every hour of the show is dedicated to a different decade in American history. For every decade, I created a costume that is conceptually adjacent, not historically accurate. Why? Because traditional historical costume already exists, conceptually and otherwise. And I like to break traditions and invent new ones. And when you break an egg, there are countless ways to turn it into something delicious. So it’s high noon in Brooklyn at St. Ann’s Warehouse. It&apos;s the top of the show in 1776, right after we freed ourselves from the British in the United States. And inspiration came when I was walking in Brooklyn, where I live. I was passing this laundromat. What were they doing? They were taking down these old, plastic, grand-opening flags. What were they doing? They were putting up new plastic, grand-opening flags. Well, I snatched them out of the garbage because, you know, and I noticed how weather-worn and brittle and fragile they were. And I got to thinking about the end of the American Revolution and how tattered and torn and broken everything must have been. And then it hit me. This costume wants to tell a story. An illegitimate child of colonialism ran away from home to New Orleans and opened the laundromat called Lou Washery, and they are celebrating the Grand Overture as the official, unofficial cheerleader of the original 13 colonies. This is maximalism. Not only is it layer upon layer aesthetically, it&apos;s idea on top of idea conceptually. It becomes its own story, almost that you can almost read like a book. Well, if history has taught us anything, it&apos;s that things change. Here we are an hour later in the show, and it&apos;s time for a costume change. An apple pie as a headdress. The care and the craft and the smell of home. And I put two pipes on Taylor&apos;s back, upholstered in a colonial fabric, steam was coming out of them at the top of that decade. But you know how it is. And they represent the invention of the steam engine, which gave way to westward expansion, for better or for worse. And then I thought, well, what else was happening? Well, George Washington was president at the time, and I was always kind of into his little cherry tree story of virtue. You know, &quot;I cannot tell a lie, I chopped down that cherry tree.&quot; And it was the French Revolution across the pond and the guillotine was like, full on. So I was like, &quot;Well, why don&apos;t I combine them together?&quot; And, oh, you know, severed heads in cherry tree drag as garment. What I&apos;m getting at is, the costume can be so much more than the costume. It can be the props, it can be the set, it can tell its own stories, it can even be its own character. It can be all of it at the same time. This kind of maximalism leaves an audience completely satisfied, yet wanting more at the same time. More is more. Well, wouldn’t you know, now it’s 7pm at night, and it&apos;s time for the Civil War. I took two distinct inventions from this time to help tell this story. I read somewhere once that the American hot dog evolved out of German immigrants selling their bratwurst and rolls on the streets during the 1860s. Well, I like that. And then this distinctive barbed wire, you know, barbed wire, a symbol of separation, security, insecurity. Well, I wanted to combine the two together. In this way of making things, I bring order to disorder. By turning barbed wire into hot dogs, what I&apos;m trying to do, hopefully, is eat through what is separating us, in this case, slavery. When you believe in something that is marginalized and goes against the mainstream of society, it is so important that you do it big, bold, brave and unapologetically, truly. OK, well, here we are after the war again. It’s time for Reconstruction. And, you know, how about the invention of the typewriter? I love the way this piece wiggles as Taylor clicks across the stage. And then the introduction of dynamite and toilet paper on rolls, how domestic! Well, I took those empty toilet paper rolls, and I painted them to look like sticks of dynamite and boom -- headdress, hello. You know, why not? Well, here we are. Now, we&apos;ve been performing all night. We&apos;re tired. It’s 10am. It&apos;s the 1980s. Just in time for the AIDS pandemic. Taylor wears two white, high-heeled shoes sprinkled with little green pom poms. They look like clown shoes, but they represent the white blood cells being attacked by HIV. This collaboration, this &quot;24-Decade History of Popular Music,&quot; took maximalism and &quot;more is more&quot; to a whole new level. I have to say, through the music, the storytelling and the transformative nature of the costumes, we changed the course of queer history. And if nothing else, it sure is fun to pull an all-nighter with 24 costume changes. Well, here we are. This is an image of me on the streets of New York City at the Easter Bonnet Parade several years ago. I am a fan of taking my art to the streets. But I have to tell you, it takes a little bit of courage to dress like this in public, particularly these days. Just about every part of my creative ethos is under attack in the United States right now. On first glance, you might see an over-the-top outfit on a Sunday, in black and white and pink. But upon closer inspection, you&apos;ll see the details, the skull peeking out, the skeletal hand creeping out of the innocent plush animals on my head. I once had my Easter bonnet ripped right off of my head in front of St. Patrick&apos;s Cathedral. Not this one. I don&apos;t think they would dare. Sometimes, I think that life is about overcoming all of your greatest fears. Life itself is how you go about that. I go all the way. I do the work. There is no happiness that I know unless I am risking something. The only true happiness that I know comes from this sense of accomplishment, by taking the risk. Well, here I am again on the streets of New York, this time for the Reclaim Pride March back in 2019 again. A good friend gave me really good advice once. &quot;Machine, it&apos;s never too early to be pre-revolutionary, and it&apos;s never too late to be post-apocalyptic chic.&quot; (Laughter) Sometimes this course of action, this transformation, is the most honest action that you can take. You owe yourself honesty. I consider it a prayer. Today, after all, is a placeholder for what&apos;s coming tomorrow. By becoming other, you avoid labels. You can change someone&apos;s life just by walking across the room because you are changing what is possible in their minds. Be more. You will get more out of life. And not just for you, for everyone around you. I&apos;m telling you, that is the Gospel truth. Another thing I wanted to say, this collective land of make-believe that we are in right now, this is very fertile, very creative space where anything is possible. Matty, let&apos;s bring it home. (Music: &quot;Miss Object of Desire&quot; by Machine Dazzle) Mother, I want to be Miss Object of Desire A walking dream, a Phoenix lips of fire Strange reflection in the perfumed air Changing faces till she settles where a memory vibrates Liberation (Applause) (Music continues) Broken glass and my dress is torn Screaming in silence Thank you.

       "2                                                                                                                                                                       Can you paint with all the colors of the wind? I love this song from the first time I heard it. I was 14, growing up in public housing in western Sydney. So maybe a little too old for this Disney classic from &quot;Pocahontas.&quot; But it spoke to me. I saw something of myself in it. At this stage, I think I knew I was queer. I mean, come on, I was rocking out to Disney. (Laughter) And look at those glasses. (Laughter) Seriously, what a queer kid. (Laughter) But I was also from a Pacific Indigenous heritage with conservative views and values. I didn&apos;t feel like I could fit into any of the boxes that were being presented to me. Straight, gay, Fijian, Australian. I couldn&apos;t pick just one color to paint with. Prior to colonization, sexuality amongst many of our Pacific islands across the region was fluid. Men would have sex with men without the stigma or shame afforded it today. Sexual intimacy was a way of being able to connect socially and relationally. Sex wasn&apos;t just for procreation. Or in marriage. It wasn&apos;t exclusively monogamous. Just because you had sex with a man didn&apos;t define your sexuality. It didn&apos;t make you an outcast. But as Europeans started to colonize the Pacific region, they brought Christian missionaries with them. They told us to cover up our beautiful bodies. We were taught shame. We were told to stop practicing Pacifica cultures and values that were seen as provocative. To a Western and white perspective, our non-binary sexuality was judged as tribal, outdated, sinful and impossible to practice alongside a Christian faith. Still today, those who are Indigenous to the Pacific are negatively impacted by whiteness. That “white is right, West is best.” I was brought up to espouse strong Christian beliefs, views and values which would shape my burgeoning identity as an adult. From these staunch conservative views, I was taught to fear the queer. Those people that were seen as unusual and fruity. And in essence, I grew to despise a part of myself. I sought to separate my queerness from my identity. I could never see myself as part of that world. Growing up, biracial and bisexual constantly challenged the way I saw the world around me. I was unsure about my thinking, feelings and behaviors around liking males and females. I was unsure about my thinking, feelings and behaviors when it came to whether I needed to be a white Australian or a Fijian person. And whether this needed to be framed within a binary to choose one over the other. In this way, I don&apos;t think that my story is unique. There&apos;s plenty of people in the queer world that have escaped conservative upbringings, religions and cultures. But this is only part of my story. Another common story in the queer community is the coming-out story. When did you tell your parents? How did they react? How it liberated you or ultimately separated you from your family. But this didn&apos;t feel like an option for me either. I believe that embedded in these particular stories, these tropes, is a part of dominant queer culture that made it very hard for me to access the queer world. For example, when I started to go to gay clubs, I would be lining up at the front of the club and often I would get door staff come up to me and go, &quot;Sorry, you do know this is a gay club, right?&quot; From these lived experiences, I feel that there is a whiteness that pervades queer culture. And I didn&apos;t want to give up my identity and my appearance as a Pacific indigenous person to be queer. Pacifica cultures really, really value and esteem the collective above the individual. For Pacifica people, our families are inextricably connected to our own sense of self-agency, self-determination, self-esteem, self-love and self-worth. Our own individual identities are meshed and intertwined with our family&apos;s reputation and standing in the community. Our mind, body and souls are inextricably connected to the broader community, to our families, to ourselves and to others. I didn&apos;t want to come out to potentially ostracize myself, to make a point to separate myself from my Pacific and faith communities. I couldn&apos;t then see my authentic self in any of these spaces. And a quick shout out to my son on the left-hand side. Round of applause for my son. (Laughs) (Applause) He said to me this morning, &quot;Daddy, make sure you mention me.&quot; So I was like, &quot;OK, son. Alright.&quot; So there you go for the recording, son. And the rest are my other family, that&apos;s up there as well. Across queer cultures and the broader community, we have learned to embrace our gender and sexual differences. We encourage individuals to be allies for each other and to support safe spaces for those that are seen to not fit in. We empower and really encourage individuals to really develop and express their self-agency, their self-determination, their self love, their self-worth. We boldly go into spaces striving to bring others with us to ensure that we can create inclusive societies for everyone. However, the dominant Western view in queer cultures is still based on the individual. Me, myself and I. And my individual pursuits towards happiness. As a queer Indigenous Pacific person, I feel that there are parts of queer culture that is white, feels very white. We may fail to see the importance of bringing our families and our cultural communities along our journey as queer people. It&apos;s either the queer way or the highway. It&apos;s one or the other. Young or old. Rich or poor. Smart or stupid. Masculine or feminine. Fit or fat. These binaries create a sense of us and them, those people. A binary approach and position that we generally in Western white societies use to determine the norm. We create, conflate, perpetuate binaries that create divisions in our society. Saints or sinner, straight or gay. I see it like this. Binaries are a very white and Western way of thinking, feeling and behaving. As individuals today, we live within these binaries and create identities that then create these labels. We use these labels to then define and confine people and places. We are one or the other. But what we fail to see is that our identities are more than a set of binaries. Our own identities are comprised of intersecting identifiers that contributes to who you are, including our age, class, color, education, gender, size, spirituality, sexuality, and so, so much more. We need to decolonize queerness, to live beyond “white is right, West is best.” Because if we don&apos;t, we&apos;re going to continue to create silos and divisions in our societies that don&apos;t create inclusive and safe spaces for everyone. For Indigenous queer people, they shape our connection to community and culture, our families. If we don&apos;t include that within our understanding of who we are, even as queer people, then we&apos;re not able to be, again, our true and authentic selves. We&apos;re not able to then be our fabulous selves as part of the queer community. And it&apos;s really, really interesting because I believe that we can learn so much from pre-colonial cultures like those that were practiced in the Pacific, that provide a different way of looking at a society. A queer way that pre-dates all the privileges that go into binary ways of thinking, feeling and behaving. Across many of our Pacifica languages we have a lot of key concepts that help solidify and support a shared understanding of the collective. For example, in Fijian, &quot;solesolevaki&quot; is all about reciprocal living, where my wellbeing is your wellbeing. I will actively seek to ensure that your well-being and every part of your life is catered for, knowing that you will do the same for me. We strive to enact “veiqaravi,” as tatted here on my hand, to serve others. We strive to also embed and embold and empower people to practice &quot;veirokovi,&quot; respect for self and others where we are relationally driven, where that is so important to our spaces and places. My sense of ability to actually put this into practice, my ability to actually understand these Indigenous perspectives has greatly helped shape and reconcile my queer identity today. But what&apos;s really interesting is that it&apos;s not just queer communities that need to decolonize itself. It&apos;s all of us as a broader society that needs to be part of a shared conversation to decolonize, deconstruct and disrupt binary ways of thinking, feeling and behaving. So how can we practically do that? Practice cultural humility, where you are constantly learning and embracing differences, where you get over yourselves and strive to learn about other people&apos;s differences and how that can be meaningfully included in the way in which you create safe spaces for everyone. I also believe it&apos;s possible to bring Indigenous perspectives into Western and white workplaces. For example, I’ve introduced the concept of “talanoa” in all of my work meetings. Talanoa is all about being able to create a safe space where everyone is able to contribute to a collective, collegial and collaborative conversation. Where people are able to bring their authentic selves into these spaces. Literally, I will chair meetings where I have no firm set agenda items and I literally would just hold space for participants just to bring themselves. So you can tell I&apos;m a social worker, right? (Laughter) Safe space, safe space, safe space. It&apos;s OK, it&apos;s OK. But it&apos;s through these safe spaces that people can bring their multiple, intersecting identifiers, including their age, their class, color, education, gender, size, spirituality, sexuality and so, so much more. I invite queer communities to come talanoa with Pacific Indigenous Communities to create robust and resilient queer cultures. I have been able to greatly reconcile my queer and Pacifica identities, which has now really been embraced to help shape how I see the world around me today. And it&apos;s through these shared perspectives and approaches that we can truly embrace cultural diversity and its differences. And to know that people can live beyond those binaries and those labels we continue to perpetuate and perpetrate against others. It is a commitment from queer communities to decolonize queerness. It&apos;s a commitment from me, from you and all of us to decolonize Western and white societies and to live beyond the binary way of thinking, feeling and behaving. I genuinely believe that it&apos;s through this common goal that we can truly learn how to paint with all the colors of the wind. “Vinaka vakalevu” and thank you.  \n",
       "3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I spent my whole career in the nonprofit sector. Street outreach, program management, fundraising, grant making, public policy, you name it, I&apos;ve done it. I&apos;ve seen a lot. And I&apos;m a really positive person, so it&apos;s actually difficult to say this. But the way we do philanthropy right now, the way we&apos;ve done it for decades, is broken. And here&apos;s how I found out. In my early 20s, I was a frontline social worker in New York City, working with people living with HIV. Many of them had multiple chronic illnesses, and they were underhoused. So I&apos;d spend my days, and even some nights, with them, running around the city to doctor&apos;s appointments and housing agencies. The day-to-day work was hard. But the hardest part was we never had had enough funding to do the work. On Friday mornings, I&apos;d go into the office to write up my case notes for the week and I&apos;d speed past front reception, not looking at the mailboxes full of blue slips. Each blue letter marked another colleague let go because of our funding crisis. Within one month, I’d lost half my team, and my caseload ballooned from 30 to over 100. And this is the reality for so many nonprofits. They&apos;re at the mercy of their funders. And when we look at those funders, they decide who and what gets funded. And it&apos;s almost always a mystery how they make those decisions. Nonprofits spend so much time fundraising, filling out pages and pages and pages of paperwork. And they&apos;re filling out so much paperwork that they hardly have any time to actually support communities, which is literally the thing that they&apos;re funded to do. After years of doing amazing work, improving every single metric, we&apos;d hear things like, &quot;I&apos;m sorry, our major donor has switched direction. They’re no longer working and investing in HIV and AIDS.” Or, “I’m sorry, we issue grants for three years max.&quot; This would never happen in the private sector. You do an amazing job for three years and then get fired? It makes no sense. So I decided to switch sides. Instead of being on the side that&apos;s asking for money, what if I went to the side that was giving money? Help them understand what was happening on the ground and make a change. So off I went into the world of philanthropy only to discover that trillions of dollars are in donor-advised funds and private foundations just waiting to be donated. Meanwhile, those nonprofits and community-led organizations are wasting so much time filling out paperwork and competing over scraps. I&apos;d hear a donor publicly support a cause like homelessness. And then behind closed doors, I&apos;d hear, &quot;They don&apos;t really know what&apos;s good for them. What they really need is ...&quot; Which is code for “donor knows best.” I was confused. How could a donor possibly know what was really needed? Their lifestyle look nothing like the people they wanted to help. The problem wasn&apos;t a lack of money. Again, trillions of dollars are sitting just waiting to be put to work. But even if we unlocked every single one of those dollars, it actually wouldn&apos;t matter because a very small group of people are making all of the decisions about funding. Their priorities, their way. Almost 70 percent of donations are directed by the top one percent of donors. And they choose causes that resonate with their lives, like their university or the arts. And these issues are overfunded. And look, I know that donors have good intentions. I really do. But good intentions are not good enough. Communities are being left behind, and we are running out of time. I wanted to shift the power dynamic from a top-down approach to a community-led model, where nonprofits and donors really work together. So in 2020, I co-founded the Foundation for Black Communities with Liban Abokor, Djaka Blais-Amare and Joseph Smith, to do exactly that. We were inspired by a radically different type of philanthropy, Black philanthropy. It&apos;s the formal and informal giving that happens in Black communities around the world. In some cases, it&apos;s the kind of giving that you don&apos;t get a tax receipt for. And I learned this mostly in my family. We do almost everything together, including box hand. Box hand is an informal savings group, and in my family we have 13 members. So twice a month we all throw a hand, meaning we put 100 dollars into the pot and one person gets the entire thing, 1,300 dollars. The person who gets the full amount rotates, and you&apos;ll get the full thing two times a year. It&apos;s helped my family buy a new fridge, pay school tuition, and you know what, we&apos;ve even put a down payment on a house using this. And sometimes we negotiate. &quot;Oh, you need your hand ahead of me? No problem, I&apos;ll wait.&quot; Of the 13 people, some really need it. It&apos;s their only means of savings. And others would be fine without it. But here, we&apos;re all equal. There is no top or bottom. It&apos;s not about charity or pity or sympathy. The goal of box hand is that everybody levels up. And it’s easier to level up together because we&apos;re accountable to the collective. This practice has existed across the African diaspora since the 1700s. In Guyana, we call it box hand. In Nigeria, its “susu.” In Mali and Senegal it’s “tontines.” In Haiti, it’s called “sol.” And in Jamaica, it’s “partner.” And the cool thing is this exists outside of the African diaspora, too. It looks slightly different from place to place. The Haida nation has potlatches, in Mexico, there&apos;s &quot;tandas&quot; and in Cambodia, there&apos;s &quot;tontine.&quot; And communities turn to each other and use this kind of collective approach when we face exclusion and systemic racism in the financial industry. For example, Black people are rejected business loans and mortgages at twice the rate of the general population. And so when we face that exclusion, we turn to our communities and are creative in our solution-making. And, you know, this has been passed down from generation to generation. My mother taught me this. She gives generously to our communities because they gave generously to her. Now and forever, the collective giving never stops. Black philanthropy is rooted in a concept called Ubuntu. It&apos;s an African philosophy widely understood as humanity towards others. And we have a saying: “I am because you are.” Or &quot;I am because we are.&quot; And that means, what affects you affects me. We&apos;re all interconnected and have a shared responsibility to one another. Ubuntu would be the guiding principle for the Foundation for Black Communities. And in order to do that, we need to make two practical shifts. Who is making funding decisions, and how those decisions are made? So the who is obvious. We&apos;re looking at Black community members, but we&apos;re looking for true, on-the-ground experts. And this is an important distinction. Some people will say to me, &quot;Rebecca, you&apos;re Black. Tell us what&apos;s best for Black communities,&quot; which is actually ridiculous. How could I possibly speak on behalf of all Black people? You can&apos;t, it&apos;s not possible. So to have real insight, we’d look for local experts and let them make the decisions. Because they know their communities, their partners and field the best. And this is what we did in our recent, 500,000-dollar youth wellness granting program. We received 99 eligible applications from Black groups working in everything from diabetes awareness to inner-city farming and after school programming. And just like box hand, we turn to the collective and extended an invitation to be part of our grant review panel. Now, the invitation was intentionally put to anybody connected to the project. It might be a program manager, a participant or a volunteer. And those volunteers became peer reviewers. The peer reviewers read each application, scored them and offered candid feedback. And then we used their rankings to allocate funding. In other words, it was the collective that made the funding decision. Now, you might be thinking, &quot;What&apos;s the big deal about that?&quot; But after years in philanthropy, I can tell you, that&apos;s not how it&apos;s typically done. It&apos;s usually the donor, maybe their relative or a CEO who has the final say. But here, we trusted community to do the work and to make those funding decisions. Luckily, we&apos;re not the first or only to pool funding and trust community to make decisions. We&apos;re part of a growing movement that&apos;s changing the power dynamics in philanthropy. And recently, because of our community-led approach and collective advocacy, the Canadian government awarded the Foundation for Black Communities a historic 200 million dollars. (Cheers and applause) This is amazing. And I&apos;m hopeful that private foundations and donors will follow this powerful example. You know, there are hundreds of community-led collaboratives working in the most pressing issues of our times. For example, there’s Right Relations Collaborative, and Indigenous peoples are making the decisions there. At the Equality Fund, feminists are making the decisions. And at CLIMA Fund, climate activists are making the decisions. When I think back on my time in the front lines, I wonder, if different people were making the funding decisions would those blue slips even have existed? Because the funding was always available. It just wasn&apos;t accessible to the communities who need it most. And this is finally changing with community-led collaborative funds. Even after all of my time in the sector, the highs and lows, I&apos;m optimistic, because the future of philanthropy is happening right now, where community-led collaboratives are the bridge between people who want to do good with their money and the people on the ground with the experience to do it. This is Ubuntu. We are all interconnected, and each of us has a role to play. I am because you are. I am because we are. Thank you. (Applause and cheers)  \n",
       "5                               I became obsessed with the relationship between the brain and the mind after suffering a series of concussions playing football and rugby in college. I felt my mind change for years after. I was studying computers at the time, and it felt as though I had damaged my hardware and that my software was running differently. Over the following years, a close friend suffered a serious neck injury and multiple friends and family members were struggling with crippling mental health issues. All around me, people that I loved dearly were being afflicted by ailments of the nervous system or the mind. I was grappling with all of this while pursuing an MFA in Design and Technology at Parsons when a friend and fellow student showed me an open-source tutorial on how to build a low-cost single-channel EEG system to detect brain activity. After a couple long nights of hacking and tinkering, I saw my brainwaves dancing across the screen for the very first time. And that moment changed my life. In that moment, I felt as though I had the possibility to help myself and the people I loved. And I also realized that I couldn&apos;t do it alone. I needed help. So in 2013, in Brooklyn, with some like-minded friends, I started OpenBCI, an open-source neurotechnology company. In the beginning, our goal was to build an inward-pointing telescope and to share the blueprints with the world so that anybody with a computer could begin peering into their own brain. At first, we were an EEG-only company. We sold brain sensors to measure brain activity. I thought that&apos;s what people wanted. But over time, we discovered people doing very strange things with our technology. Some people were connecting the equipment to the stomach to measure the neurons in the gut and study gut-brain connection and the microbiome. Others were using the tools to build new muscle sensors and controllers for prosthetics and robotics. And some were designing new devices and peripheral add-ons that could be connected to the platform to measure new types of data that I had never heard of before. What we learned from all of this is that the brain by itself is actually quite boring. Turns out brain data alone lacks context. And what we ultimately care about is not the brain, but the mind, consciousness, human cognition. When we have things like EMG sensors to measure muscle activity or ECG sensors to measure heart activity, eye trackers and even environmental sensors to measure the world around us, all of this makes the brain data much more useful. But the organs around our body, our sensory receptors, are actually much easier to collect data from than the brain, and also arguably much more important for determining the things that we actually care about: emotions, intentions and the mind overall. Additionally, we realized that people weren&apos;t just interested in reading from the brain and the body. They were also interested in modulating the mind through various types of sensory stimulation. Things like light, sound, haptics and electricity. It&apos;s one thing to record the mind, it&apos;s another to modulate it. The idea of a combined system that can both read from and write to the brain or body is referred to as a closed-loop system or bidirectional human interface. This concept is truly profound, and it will define the next major revolution in computing technology. When you have products that not just are designed for the average user but are designed to actually adapt to their user, that&apos;s something truly special. When we know what the data of an emotion or a feeling looks like and we know how to make that data go up or down, then using AI, we can build constructive or destructive interference patterns to either amplify or suppress those emotions or feelings. In the very near future, we will have computers that we are resonantly and subconsciously connected to, enabling empathetic computing for the very first time. In 2018, we put these learnings to work and began development of a new tool for cognitive exploration. Named after my friend Gael, who passed from ALS in 2016, we call it Galea. It’s a multimodal bio-sensing headset, and it is absolutely packed with sensors. It can measure the user’s heart, skin, muscles, eyes and brain, and it combines that capability with head-mounted displays or augmented and virtual reality headsets. Additionally, we&apos;re exploring the integration of non-invasive electrical neural stimulation as a feature. The Galea software suite can turn the raw sensor data into meaningful metrics. With some of the sensors, we&apos;re able to provide new forms of real-time interactivity and control. And with all of the sensors, we&apos;re able to make quantifiable inferences about high-level states of mind, things like stress, fatigue, cognitive workload and focus. In 2019, a legendary neurohacker by the name of Christian Bayerlein reached out to me. He was actually one of our very first Kickstarter backers when we got started, early on. Christian was a very smart, intelligent, happy-go-lucky and easygoing guy. And so I worked up the courage to ask him, &quot;Hey, Christian, can we connect you to our sensors?&quot; At which point he said, &quot;I thought you would never ask.&quot; (Laughter) So after 20 minutes, we had him rigged up to a bunch of electrodes, and we provided him with four new inputs to a computer. Little digital buttons, that he could control voluntarily. This essentially doubled his number of inputs to a computer. Years later, after many setbacks due to COVID, we flew to Germany to work with Christian in person to implement the first prototype of what we&apos;re going to be demoing here today. Christian then spent months training with that prototype and sending his data across the Atlantic to us in Brooklyn from Germany and flying a virtual drone in our offices. The first thing that we did was scour Christian&apos;s body for residual motor function. We then connected electrodes to the four muscles that he had the most voluntary control over, and then we turned those muscles into digital buttons. We then applied some smart filtering and signal processing to adapt those buttons into something more like a slider or a digital potentiometer. After that, we turned those four sliders and mapped them to a new virtual joystick. Christian then combined that new joystick with the joystick that he uses with his lip to control his wheelchair, and with the two joysticks combined, Christian finally had control over all the manual controls of a drone. I’m going to stop talking about it, and we’re going to show you. Christian, welcome. (Applause) At this point, I&apos;m going to ask everybody to turn off your Bluetooth and put your phones in airplane mode so that you don&apos;t get hit in the face with a drone. (Laughter) How are you feeling, Christian? Christian Bayerlein: Yeah, let&apos;s do it. Conor Russomanno: Awesome. This is a heads-up display that&apos;s showing all of Christian&apos;s biometric data, as well as some information about the drone. On the left here, we can see Christian&apos;s muscle data. Christian is now going to attempt to fly the drone. How are you feeling, Christian, feeling good? CB: Yes. CR: All right. Rock and roll. Let&apos;s take this up for a joyride. Whenever you&apos;re ready. CB: I&apos;m ready. (Applause and cheers) CR: All right, take her up. And now let&apos;s do something we probably shouldn&apos;t do and fly it over the audience. (Laughter) (Cheers and applause) Alright, actually, let’s do this. I&apos;m going to ask for people to call out some commands in the audience. So how about you? Straight forward. Straight forward. (Laughter) Alright. How about you? Man: Up! (Laughter) CR: Not down. Oh, he&apos;s doing what he wants right now. Amazing. (Cheers and applause) Alright, let’s bring it back. And what I&apos;m going to do right now is take control of the controller so that you guys know that there isn&apos;t someone backstage flying this drone. All right, Christian, you&apos;re alright with that? CB: Yeah. CR: Unplug. Forward. And we&apos;re going to land this guy now. CB: I think I was better than you. (Laughter) (Applause) CR: Amazing. (Applause) Now I&apos;m going to unplug it so it doesn&apos;t turn on on its own. Perfect. Christian has repurposed dormant muscles from around his body for extended and augmented interactivity. We have turned those muscles into a generic controller that in this case we&apos;ve mapped into a drone, but what&apos;s really cool is that joystick can be applied to anything. Another thing that&apos;s really cool is that even in individuals who are not living with motor disabilities, there exist dozens of dormant muscles around the body that we can tap into for augmented and expanded control interactivity. And lastly, all the code related to that virtual joystick, we&apos;re going to open source so that you can implement it and improve upon it. There&apos;s three things that have stood out to me from working on this project and many others over the years. One, we cannot conflate the brain with the mind. In order to understand emotions and tensions and the mind overall, we have to measure data from all over the body, not just the brain. Two, open-source technology access and literacy is one way that we can combat the potential ethical challenges we face in introducing neural technology to society. But that&apos;s not enough. We have to do much, much more than that. It&apos;s very important, imperative, that we set up guardrails and design the future that we want to live in. Three. It&apos;s the courage and resilience of trailblazers like Christian who don&apos;t get bogged down by what they can&apos;t do, but instead strive to prove that the impossible is in fact possible. (Applause) And since none of this would have been possible without you, Christian, the stage is yours. CB: Yeah, hi, everybody. Audience: Hi. CB: I&apos;m excited to be here today. I was born with a genetic condition that affects my mobility and requires me to have assistance. Despite my disability, I&apos;m a very happy and fulfilled person. What truly holds me back are not my physical limitations. It&apos;s rather the barriers in the environment. I&apos;m a tech nerd and political activist. I believe that technology can empower disabled people. It can help create a better, more inclusive and accessible world for everyone. This demonstration is a perfect example. We saw what&apos;s possible when cutting edge technology is combined with human curiosity and creativity. So let&apos;s build tools that empower people, applications that break down barriers and systems that unlock a world of possibilities. I think that&apos;s an idea worth spreading. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)  \n",

A footballer? An actress? A doctor? Well, when I was a little girl, whenever I was asked the question, my answer was pretty much always the same: &quot;When I grow up, I want to become a man.&quot; To my logic, that was the only way I could live a life free from the suffocating restrictions that women in my birth country of Iran were forced to endure. I&apos;m not quite sure where this line of thinking started from, but a particularly hot summer&apos;s afternoon comes to mind. I was nine years old and along with my family, as we did on every summer holiday, we had traveled to the north of Iran to a little seaside village called Chamkhaleh. For as long as I remember, some of my best childhood memories are of me swimming in the Caspian Sea, paddling in its waves and making sandcastles on its gorgeous beaches. All of those lovely memories, though, were about to be rewritten. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, when a girl turns nine years old, she has legally entered womanhood. And that means having to follow a series of restrictive rules written by men. The most symbolic of which is probably the mandatory wearing of the hijab. That year, my mom had to sit me down and sorrowfully explain that I was now too old to get into the water wearing a swimsuit. Now that I was nine years old, it was illegal. And if I wanted to get into the water like all the other women, I had to go in fully covered from head to toe. I had to go in wearing a pair of trousers, a long-sleeved top and a loose covering called the manto to cover it all. And of course, the headscarf. I still remember the lump in my throat as I set foot in the water. I could no longer feel the fresh coolness of the Caspian Sea against my skin. Instead, my now-wet layers felt itchy and weird. I can still remember feeling the watchful eyes of the morality police, the so-called morality police, making sure that me and the other girls were not showing too much hair or too much skin to, God forbid, arouse the men. It was as if my former freedoms were washing away with every tide and flow of the water. Next, I&apos;m deep in the water. I was a good swimmer, but my layers were so heavy and restrictive. I tried to gasp for air, but my headscarf kept blocking my face. The tides were pulling me further and further out. I could see my mom and dad on the beach, I tried to call for help, but they couldn&apos;t hear me. Perhaps my voice was drowned out by the roaring engines of the bikes that the morality police were patrolling the beaches. The tides continued, pulling me further and further out and hopelessness started creeping in. Next, I wake up on the beach, cold, wet, shivering. It turns out my father had just spotted my struggles in time and had rushed in to get me. That was the last time I ever set foot in my beloved Caspian Sea. Growing up in the Islamic Republic of Iran, every day it felt as though I was going through the same experience but in different ways. And looking at the women in my life, they seemed to be going through the same thing too, in different ways. And the older I grew, the further out the tides of oppression, injustice, inequality felt like they were pulling me in. Wherever I turned, shame, fear and especially hopelessness were ever-present. Women in Iran are second-class citizens. They have almost no access when it comes to some of the most basic rights like divorce, custody of children and even travel. They have no legal protection against sexual harassment and domestic violence. They are not allowed to sing in public or have sex outside of marriage, and they&apos;re only allowed to show their face and hand in public. In the 20 years or so since I almost drowned, nothing has changed. Iranian women have been adrift in a vast sea of oppression. Their only way out, for those who could, is to leave themselves at the mercy of people smugglers, set out on dangerous journeys in hope of finding safety in a land far away. That&apos;s what happened to me. Age 12, along with my mom and my baby sister, we escaped Iran. And after years of living in refugee camps across Europe, sleeping rough and being at the mercy of some very, very dodgy people smugglers, we finally found safe haven here, in the UK. For my friends and family who stayed behind, there was little hope for change. And so when in September last year, 22-year-old Mahsa Jina Amini stepped out of the metro onto the bustling streets of Tehran, there was little reason to expect a change to the status quo. The same way that it&apos;s happened to my own mother and many other women I know, Mahsa was arrested by the so-called morality police because, in their opinion, she was showing more hair than they deemed acceptable. Three days later, Mahsa died in police custody. This time, though, something changed. Thanks to the power of social media and the brave journalists working hard on the ground, the news of Mahsa&apos;s killing wasn&apos;t drowned out in the regime&apos;s relentless propaganda. In the same way that the unjust killing of George Floyd ignited the Black Lives Matter movement, the unjust killing of Mahsa Amini ignited the biggest anti-regime protests across Iran since the formation of the Islamic Republic in 1979. For the first time in decades, women in Iran are finally daring to defy the strict morality laws. In a fight for equality and dignity, they are taking off their headscarves, burning them in bonfires, and some are cutting off their hair. They&apos;re chanting &quot;Zan. Zendegi. Azadi.&quot; &quot;Woman, Life, Freedom.&quot; Furious crowds are calling for democracy, for freedom of speech, for freedom of expression, whilst many others are calling for the fall of the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Khamenei is Iran&apos;s spiritual leader and has the final say over all government matters. For the first time in a very, very long time, there seems to be hope in the air. Hope that perhaps change in Iran is possible. And that&apos;s exactly why the crackdown has been so brutal and deadly. These are the faces of the protesters who fought for freedom but will not live to see it. Since the protest began nearly five months ago, around 500 people have been killed. Nearly 80 of those children. Around 18,000 protesters have been arrested. And there are reports of psychological, physical and sexual torture in prisons. There has been a series of hasty trials, forced confessions and public executions of the protesters. The authoritarian regime of Iran is clearly desperate to kill any and all hope because they know that for as long as we remain hopeless, we&apos;ll resign to their oppression and injustice. But as history has shown over and over again, the light of hope emerges from the depth of darkness. Hope is angry. It&apos;s defiant. Hope is dangerous. Hope is standing its ground on the streets of Iran, chanting &quot;Woman, Life, Freedom.&quot; Hope is in political prisons, biding its time, sustaining those in shackles. Hope has now spread to the four corners of my birth country. As a journalist, I can&apos;t travel to Iran. But as my sisters in Tehran, Mashhad, Shiraz, Baluchistan, Kurdistan, shomal, jonoob, shargh, gharb, all over Iran have done, I, too, I&apos;m going to cut my hair to show my solidarity with the movement. (Cheers and applause) (Cheers and applause continues) Thank you. (Applause continues) (Applause ends) Thank you. Audience: Freedom for women! (Cheers) SZ: This hair, for too long, has been intertwined with religion and politics. But I say with my sisters in Iran: no more. And I say with them: Women, to reclaim our rights. (Applause and cheers) Life, for the lives unjustly taken. (Applause) Freedom, for the liberation of my people. (Applause) I stand here with my hair in my hand, in hope of a future where no little girl has to wish she were a man because she&apos;s terrified that she might drown every day. (Applause) Yes, the crackdown is brutal. And yes, there might not be a solution inside yet. But the only thing that can help create and sustain one is hope. Sorry. (Cheers and applause) The only thing that can help create and sustain one is hope. And every single one of us can take a step and play our part. I&apos;m standing here speaking to you now. Many non-Iranians and Iranians outside of Iran have been signing petitions, going to protest, putting pressure on their governments so that in turn, they put pressure on the Iranian regime and government. For the past few months, I&apos;ve been speaking to protesters inside of Iran, and they tell me how much it matters to them that we on the outside stay informed and engaged. So let&apos;s try our best to make certain that those of us on the shore let those at sea know that we see them, that we hear their cries. Thank you for taking a step towards a future where freedom is not just a dream, but a reality. Not just for women, but for everyone. And not just in Iran, but everywhere. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)  "

       "49      OK, I'll give it to you straight -- we need at least four trillion dollars per year by 2030 to avert a climate crisis. And right now, that money simply isn't flowing at the rate we need to keep this planet habitable. Now I work with a lot of banks and investors, and everyone who I talk to -- and I work with some of the leading ones around the world -- they get what needs to be done. They're aware of the climate risks and they're actually really excited about the unprecedented opportunities to finance the green economy of the future. And here's the good news. Over 450 financial institutions around the world have committed to aligning their financing to net-zero by 2050. And collectively, these financial institutions manage over 130 trillion dollars. OK, so we need trillions, we've got trillions. Problem solved, right? Shortest TED Talk ever. (Laughter) I wish that were the case. But now, as we're working to deliver on those commitments, it's actually proving to be really hard. Like, really hard to deploy real money into real technologies that will actually really decarbonize the world. And as a result, too much of that money, it's sitting on the sidelines, waiting to be put to work. But I think we can change that. And it's not even what I think -- I know we can, because it's based on what banks and investors tell me about what they need to go fast and go far. And what they need is help from people like you and me. So to bring this idea to life, let's zoom in on one part of the economy, one that we can all relate to -- it's close to home. Let's talk about housing. Because, believe it or not, the challenges we're facing with housing and the challenges we're facing with climate are inextricably linked, so as we solve for one, we can solve for the other. You see, we're facing two concurrent challenges right now, with housing. On one hand, there's an affordability challenge. There's just a scarcity of homes that are affordable right now. Here in the United States, there's a scarcity of over seven million homes that people who live at or below the poverty line can afford to rent. And the other affordability challenge is it's less affordable than ever before to live in one, because they're so energy-inefficient. These older, less energy-efficient homes tend to be in Black and <b>B</b>rown neighborhoods due to the structural nature of poverty. And get this -- a recent study found that the average renter who is Black pays over 250 dollars more per year in utility bills than one who is white. OK, so we need to build a lot more affordable housing. Great. But that's when we run into the climate challenge, because the buildings that we live in are one of the leading contributors to the greenhouse gasses that are fueling climate change. And if we take a business-as-usual approach to just building all this housing, we'll only exacerbate the climate challenge. Think about the emissions from all that cement and steel and concrete that goes into a high-rise, for example. So, a pretty sticky challenge. But that's why I love working in sustainable finance and investing, because we get to take challenges like this and transform them to opportunities, specifically financing opportunities. Opportunities to deploy debt, equity, grants by governments, investors and banks. And in the housing sector, the financing opportunities are enormous. We recently did a study. We found over a trillion dollars' worth of things that banks can finance to lower the emissions associated with our housing. OK, great, so what will it take? How can we actually get this done? Well, here's the catch. You see, banks work within prescribed risk thresholds, and some of the things we need most -- like replacements for that high-carbon cement, steel, concrete -- they're being developed by companies right now that are still relatively early-stage, and might not yet fit within those risk thresholds. Similarly, building affordable homes in a low-income community or a low-income country might not reach the return thresholds that investors are looking for. When I talk to banks and investors, they say they need the right type of public policies, they need the right type of capital and they need demand in order to put this money to work. So that's where you and I can come in, because there are some simple moves that you and I can do that can help to create the conditions that will allow this money to flow. I'm going to talk you through these different moves, and as I'm talking, just bear in mind, these moves are not exclusive to housing. We could apply this playbook in any sector where we need faster climate action. OK, let's dive in. The first thing that we can do to really move these trillions of dollars is make the climate-housing connection matter to government. Governments have a huge role to play in climate finance. But when I talk to banks and investors, there's one particular form of government funding that they say would make a huge difference, and it's called blended or catalytic finance. You see, the private sector, banks and investors, they have a lot of capital, but not necessarily always the right risk appetite. On the other hand, governments are willing to take some risks, especially for things like the climate or shelter equity, but they don't have as much capital. So what blended finance involves is governments deploying their finance in instruments like guarantees, or more concessional forms of lending, and this allows that private-sector finance to flow when the governments take on more of that risk. And this kind of blended or catalytic finance has proven to be tremendously effective in areas like affordable housing, where a little bit of government money can go a long way. OK, great, so that's how we can get some money flowing, but there is more that we need from governments, and I call them the three p's: public policies, programs, permits. And to bring this to life, let me tell you a story of a bank that I'm working with. They have bold ambitions. They want to bring all the financing in line with net-zero targets by 2050, including their financing for homes. And as we worked to bring this ambition to life, we ran into three key challenges. In a lot of the markets where they operate, the right public policies just weren't in place. Minimum energy-efficiency standards just didn't exist. Moreover, the programs to incentivize homeowners to put solar panels on their roof or retrofit their homes, the kind of thing that the bank was willing to finance, they just weren't available at sufficient scale. And finally, when the bank was looking for big-ticket things to finance, like entirely new housing developments that were affordable and low-emissions, they found that projects were held up in permitting. And so their good intentions remained stalled, and so did the money. But that's where people like you and I can come in, we the voters and constituents, because we can demand that governments do this. We can demand that they put in place that financing, those programs, those permits. And look, I get it. Right now, it's a little bit of a complicated time for many countries, at the national level, around climate-change policy. But the exciting thing about housing is a lot of the changes that we need are superlocal ... where small numbers of voters can actually make a huge difference. So let's do this. Let's put climate and, importantly, actions that drive climate finance, at the top of the agenda for every local government. Let's write to our local officials and say 'Look, the banks and investors, they're ready to put money to work. And if we can just put in place the right policies, programs, permits, that money can come to our community.' Let's back the candidates that back climate action and, importantly, let's show up to vote. OK, that's the first move -- we can mobilize governments. But if we want to mobilize big money, we also have to look at the big balance sheets. So here's the second move. If you have an insurance policy or a pension, this one's for you. You see, pension plans, insurance companies, they're managing huge balance sheets. They're often referred to as institutional investors. And these institutional investors, they're managing your money for the long run. And the good news is that in recent years, they have increasingly begun to appreciate that the long-term risks associated with climate change present a material risk to their ability to manage your money. And so they've started taking action to manage those climate risks. Well, thanks to the pandemic and the recent focus on racial equity, they're now appreciating that social inequities also create these long-term financial risks, and they're ready to step up and take action. Here's some good news -- in 2020, investors financed over 140 billion dollars' worth of social bonds. That's up from 17 billion just the year before. What are social bonds? They’re bonds [where] proceeds can be used towards addressing social inequities, including things like affordable housing. So when I talk to these investors and ask them, 'OK, you're doing billions, that's great, but what would it take to get to trillions?' they say it all comes down to having a mandate, a mandate to better integrate these environmental or social considerations into how they manage your money, the mandate to actually put the money to work. So how can we give them that mandate? Well, there's two ways. One is insurance companies and pension plans are increasingly giving you options to move your money from a general pool into a more dedicated one that manages money with greater environmental and social considerations in mind. And if you don't have that option, demand it. Large pension plans, insurance companies, they have teams whose job it is to listen to your concerns. I know, because that was one of my first jobs out of college, to just answer phones for a large pension plan in Canada. And the more we speak up and influence these large investors who are managing our money and make clear how we want them to consider environmental and social causes, the more of a mandate they will have to put those trillions to work. OK, so first move is governments, second is the institutional investors. The third move is ourselves. We need to create the demand for these greener solutions. Let me give you a few examples. You know, most banks, they'll offer a discount for your mortgage if it meets minimum energy-efficiency standards. But guess what? Few people take them up on that offer. Similarly, I worked for a large real-estate investment company. They were willing to do the right thing, to retrofit their buildings and build entirely new ones with new materials that would make it a low-carbon building altogether. But you know what they told me? Aside from a few markets in Europe, they just weren't seeing the demand. So I think we can take some inspiration from the other aspects of our lives, like the food we eat or the vehicles we drive, where we have shown banks and investors that it's worth financing alternatives to meat, or electric vehicles. Let's bring that shift now into the homes in which we live, and let's show them that it's worth financing more energy-efficient, lower-carbon homes. So when you're out to buy or rent your next home, ask about energy efficiency, and even better, ask about the overall carbon footprint. So there are three things we can do. We can activate governments. We can mobilize these large, institutional investors. We can create the demand ourselves. You know, as anyone in finance would hate to admit it, money doesn't make the world go around. This big, beautiful blue and green planet that we live on, it's been spinning on its axis for long before we were here and will continue to do so for long after we've gone. What money can do is influence just how long we'll be here to enjoy the ride. Thank you very much. (Cheers and applause)\n",

                                                                                                             On January 12th, 1967,  James Bedford passed away. But— he had a plan to cheat death. Bedford was the first person to be cryogenically frozen. This process promised to preserve  his body until a theoretical future when humanity could cure any illness, and essentially, reverse death. This is the dream of cryonics. But here’s the catch:  to revive people in the future, we need to properly preserve them in the present. So, is it currently possible to freeze a human, preserve them indefinitely,  and then safely thaw them out? To understand the hurdles  of human cryopreservation, we need to leave  the theoretical realm of cryonics, and turn to the scientific field  of cryobiology. This discipline studies the effects of low temperatures on various living systems, and it is true that decreasing  an organism’s temperature also decreases its cellular function. For example, at temperatures below -130 degrees Celsius, human cellular activity grinds to a halt. So if you could bring an entire human body below that temperature, theoretically you could preserve it indefinitely. The hard part is doing this without damaging the body. For example, let's try to freeze a single red blood cell. It typically sits at a temperature  of 37 degrees Celsius in a solution of water and substances  known as chemical solutes, which dissolve under certain conditions. But once the temperature  drops below freezing, water outside and inside the cell  hardens into damaging ice crystals. Without the correct concentration of water, the chemical solutes are unable to dissolve. And as the water freezes,  they become increasingly concentrated in a destructive process  known as osmotic shock. Without any intervention, these factors are guaranteed to destroy  our red blood cell before it reaches -130 degrees. Not all cells are this fragile, and many animals have evolved  to survive extreme conditions. Some cold-tolerant fish synthesize antifreeze proteins to prevent ice<b> </b>formation  at sub-zero temperatures. And freeze-tolerant frogs  use protective agents to survive when up to 70% of their body water is trapped as ice. It's unlikely that any one creature holds the secret to human cryopreservation. But by researching these adaptations, scientists have developed remarkable preservation technologies, some of which are already employed in medicine. However, researchers are still trying to improve cryopreservation technology to better manage the ice problem. Many cryobiologists are trying to solve this issue with an approach called vitrification. This technique uses chemicals known as cryoprotectant agents (CPA) to prevent ice from forming. Some of these have been adapted from compounds in nature, while others have been designed  to take advantage of cryobiology’s guiding principles. But in practice, these chemicals allow researchers to store living systems in a glassy state with reduced  molecular activity and no damaging ice. Vitrification is ideal for cryonics, and would help preserve organs and other tissues for medical procedures. But it’s incredibly difficult to achieve. CPAs can be toxic in the high quantities required for large scale vitrification. And even with these chemicals, preventing ice formation  requires rapid cooling that lowers temperatures  uniformly throughout the material. That’s relatively easy when vitrifying single cells or small pieces of tissue. But as the material becomes more complex and contains larger quantities of water, staying ahead of ice formation gets challenging. And even if we could successfully vitrify complex living material, we'd only be halfway to using it. Vitrified tissue also needs  to be uniformly warmed to prevent the formation of ice, or worse, cracks. To date, researchers have been able to vitrify and partially recover small structures like blood vessels, heart valves, and corneas. But none of these are anywhere  near the size and complexity of a whole human being. So if it’s not currently possible to cryopreserve a person, what does this mean for Bedford and his frozen peers? The sad truth is that current  cryonic preservation techniques only offer their patients false hope. As practiced, they’re both unscientific and deeply destructive, irreparably damaging the body’s cells, tissues, and organs. Some devotees might argue that, like death and disease, this damage may be reversible one day. Even if scientists could revive people through cryonic preservation, there’s a whole suite of ethical, legal, and social implications which cast doubts  on the technology’s overall benefits. But for now, the dream of cryonics is still on ice.\n",

                                                    Your plan to set up your friend Carey with your acquaintance Emerson is finally coming together. Both individuals have heard  all about each other and they’re eager to meet for dinner. You’ve just made them a reservation for Friday night, and you’re about to text Carey  the details when an unsettling thought crosses your mind: Carey is always<i> </i>late. And not just by 5 minutes; we’re talking 20 or even 30 minutes late. Carey seems to view punctuality  as an oppressive relic of an earlier era. But what if you told them dinner was at 6 instead of 6:30? That way, they would almost certainly arrive on time. You really want this relationship to work, so... should you lie? Take a moment to think: what you would do? Maybe you should lie! You think this new relationship could be great for Carey, and you don’t want them to ruin it before it’s even begun. Sure, Emerson may eventually learn about their chronic lateness. But if Carey shows up on time just this once, the relationship will at least have a chance to take root. Your lie would pave the way for a potentially happy relationship. And if taking an action will create  a better outcome for everyone involved, that’s normally a pretty good reason to take it. But isn't it morally wrong to lie? The absolutist position on lying, associated with German philosopher Immanuel Kant, holds that lying is always immoral, regardless of the circumstances. In other words, there’s a moral rule which forbids lying, and that rule is absolute. You might think, though,  that this stance overstates the moral importance of lying. Suppose a murderer were hunting Carey down. If the killer asked you  about Carey’s whereabouts, it seems odd to say  that you must tell the truth at the cost of your friend’s life. From this perspective,  absolutism seems too rigid. By contrast, utilitarian philosopher  John Stuart Mill would say lying is wrong only when it leads to less happiness overall. Now, to be fair, most lies do seem likely to create unhappiness. Someone who accepts a lie believes something which is false, and trying to conduct your life  on the basis of false information doesn’t usually go well. However, in some circumstances,  perhaps including your situation, lying might produce more happiness overall. In those cases, utilitarians say it’s not morally wrong to lie. In fact, it might even be your moral duty to do so. But if absolutism seems too extreme, you might feel this stance is too lax. In other words, perhaps the utilitarian position understates the moral significance of lying. Most people generally feel some regret about lying, even when they believe it’s the right thing to do. This suggests there’s something  inherently objectionable about lying— even when it leads to more happiness. In this case, lying to Carey would be an instance of Paternalism. Paternalism is interfering  with another person’s choices for that person's benefit. This might be fine if that person is a literal child. But it seems disrespectful to treat a peer paternalistically. Lying to Carey would mean  taking away their opportunity to handle the situation as they see fit, based on their own beliefs and values. Trying to protect Carey  from what you consider to be a bad choice would show a lack of respect for their autonomy. By extension, it might also be disrespectful towards Emerson, since you would be deliberately trying to give him a false impression of Carey’s punctuality. So how do you weigh potential happiness against guaranteed disrespect? Followers of Kant would say  treating others with respect is the heart of moral conduct, while followers of Mill would say nothing is more important than happiness. But other philosophers believe  that such conflicts can only be resolved on a case-by-case basis, depending on various details and on the individuals involved. So what will you do in Carey’s case?\n",

                                            You’re a butterfly, fluttering around pursuing a butterfly’s whims. Then you wake up. But how do you know you’re not dreaming now? The answer might seem obvious, but it’s actually very difficult  to explain how, definitively, you know you’re awake. So difficult, in fact, that it has puzzled philosophers since ancient times. In the butterfly scenario, the ancient Chinese philosopher Zhuangzi surfaced a mystifying possibility: if we can dream of being  an entirely different creature, who's to say we're not actually a different creature dreaming  of being human? Bizarre things happen in dreams: you fly, or conjure an all-you-can-eat  dessert buffet out of thin air, or get chased by witches through the halls of your elementary school, which suddenly looks a lot like Paris. But the strange things that happen  in dreams don’t seem strange at the time. So how do you know you’re not in a dream right now that will seem very strange after you wake up? Well, it is<i> </i>possible to notice the strangeness of a dream while you’re dreaming. Lucid dreamers know they’re dreaming. By definition, if you were having  a lucid dream, you would know it. But all that proves is  that you’re not having a lucid dream— it doesn’t prove you’re awake. There has to be a surefire test— something that never— or only— happens when you’re awake, something that never— or only— happens in a dream. Wake up. No, that isn’t it— you can wake up in a dream. Pinch yourself. If it hurts, aren’t you really awake? Try to read or write something. Run around the room. Does your pace seem normal  or suspiciously slow? Suspiciously fast? Can’t tell? Try to remember the last time you ran. Actually, that brings us  to an even better test from the 17th century French philosopher René Descartes. He pointed out that in our memories, dreams are disconnected— the events of a dream don’t fit in to the chain of events in our waking lives. This seems rock solid, doesn't it? You couldn’t possibly have swum  with dolphins in a nameless pink sea between Christmas  and New Year’s Eve because you didn’t leave Kansas  and you have the receipts to prove it. Well, one of Descartes’ contemporaries, the English philosopher Thomas Hobbes, had something to say about that: what if Descartes was performing his test in a dream? What if we ask an expert? A neuroscientist can measure the activity in different parts of your brain and tell you whether you’re awake or sleeping. But that just brings us back to the idea that any test you might use to prove you’re awake  could take place in a dream. So far, no one has found a convincing response to this. But let’s be real: there’s a whole lot more detail in our waking experience than in dreams. We go to sleep and wake up again day after day for many years, and each new day is full  of countless  people, places, things, experiences. Even our memories, which capture  just a fraction of this experience, contain an almost incomprehensibly vast amount of detail: we can recall a line from a favorite book decades later, remember the musty smell of its pages and the taste of the lemonade we drank  while reading it, remember a dream we had about it and tell someone all this. Isn't it ridiculous to suggest a dream could ever simulate this richness? Well, as the Persian philosopher al-Ghazali pointed out, in the same way we think we are now awake having woken from dreams, it is possible that we might wake  from our current state into another state  of even greater wakefulness. Which would mean we’re really in a kind of dream-state when we think we’re awake. What philosophers really want to know  is what justifies our belief that we’re awake. We all want to believe things because we have reasons for them, not just because they seem right. Sometimes, the biggest challenge is  to show why we should believe something that seems completely obvious to us all.\n",

                                          Emotional abuse can be incredibly damaging, increasing a person’s chances  of developing depression and anxiety sometimes for decades after the fact. Broadly speaking, emotional abuse involves one person controlling another by undermining their sense of self-worth and personal agency. But emotionally abusive behaviors can be subtle and difficult to spot, both from within  and outside the abusive relationship. That’s partly because emotional abuse often exploits or creates power imbalances  between individuals, especially in relationships where safety, care, and trust are supposed to be guaranteed, like the relationship between a caregiver and a child, healthcare provider and patient, teacher and student, or intimate partners. It’s especially insidious because  it often makes people doubt their perceptions  of their own mistreatment. So let’s walk through some of the most common signs of emotional abuse, to make these behaviors and patterns easier to spot in real life. First, the content of someone’s words: criticism that’s out of proportion to a situation, excessively harsh or personal, or makes sweeping generalizations or baseless negative predictions  for the future is a warning sign of emotional abuse. Statements like, “You always make such stupid decisions,” “You never do anything right,”  and “Nobody else will ever love you,” aren’t constructive;  they’re never warranted, and someone’s use of them is a red flag. Second, tone and non-verbal cues: yelling, ignoring and showing contempt through body language are all ways to degrade someone. Dismissive behaviors like eye rolling, glaring, or refusal to make eye contact, along with refusing to speak to someone or acknowledge their presence— sometimes called “the silent treatment”— can all feature in patterns  of emotional abuse. These behaviors can painfully transform the meaning of spoken statements  that might otherwise seem benign. Third, how someone reacts to being told they’ve said or done something hurtful  can give important insight: do they apologize sincerely  and act differently in the future, or do they dismiss and minimize the pain they’ve caused? It’s common for abusers to try  to undermine their target’s perceptions of events— this is sometimes referred  to as “gaslighting.” Following up demeaning, humiliating, or threatening remarks with comments that dismiss the impact of those remarks, like “I’m just trying to help you  improve yourself— you should be grateful,” or “It’s really you that’s selfish  and manipulative— you’re<i> </i>hurting me,” are examples of this behavior. Lastly, when someone directs any  of these behaviors at you, take note of whether this is part  of a pattern of behavior from them. A one-time incident of name-calling or a demeaning insult might not be emotional abuse, while repetition over time can have  a much more serious impact. Both frequency, how often these behaviors occur in a given period of time, and duration, or how long they last,  whether days or years, can contribute  to the severity of the abuse. It’s also important to remember  that abusers rarely engage in abusive behaviors 100% of the time— moments of kindness or calm  don’t invalidate moments of abuse, but are actually part of the cycle of emotional manipulation. So what can you do if you think you or someone you care about is experiencing emotional abuse? Maintaining interpersonal ties with people other than the abuser is crucial, as abusers often try to isolate  their targets from others close to them. If you think you might be experiencing emotional abuse, consider sharing your experiences with a trusted friend or relative to get outside support. Or you can seek local or national confidential advocacy centers that can provide helpful resources. And if you think someone you know is being emotionally abused, check in with them. Let them know you’re thinking of them and that you're ready to listen whenever they'd like to share. While emotional abusers may convince people that they deserve to be mistreated, nobody does: everyone deserves kindness and respect.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                On October 21st, 1909, 125 residents  of an affluent Minneapolis neighborhood approached William Simpson, who’d just bought a plot in the area, and told him to leave. The Simpsons would be the second  Black family in the otherwise white neighborhood,   where they intended to build a home. When the Simpsons refused offers  to buy them out, their neighbors tried blocking their home’s construction. They finally moved into their house,  but the incident had a ripple effect. Just a few months  after the mob harassed the Simpsons, the first racially restrictive covenant was put into place in Minneapolis. Covenants are agreements in property deeds that are intended to regulate how the property is to be used. Beginning in the mid-1800s, people in the United States and elsewhere began employing them in a new way: specifically,  to racially restrict properties. They wrote clauses into deeds that were  meant to prevent  all future owners from selling or leasing  to certain racial and ethnic groups, especially Black people. Between 1920 and 1950, these racial covenants spread like wildfire throughout the US, making cities more segregated  and the suburbs more restricted. In the county encompassing Minneapolis, racial covenants eventually appeared  on the deeds to more than 25,000 homes. Not only was this legal, but the US Federal Housing Administration promoted racial covenants  in their underwriting manual. While constructing new homes, real estate developers began racially restricting them from the outset. Developments were planned as dream communities for American families— but for white people only. In 1947, one company began building what became widely recognized as the prototype of the postwar American suburb: Levittown, New York. It was a community  of more than 17,000 identical homes. They cost around $7,000 each  and were intended to be affordable for returning World War II veterans. But, according to Levittown’s  racial covenants, none of the houses could “be used or occupied by any person  other than members of the Caucasian race,” with one exception: servants. Between 1950 and 1970, the population of the American suburbs nearly doubled as white people flocked  to more racially homogenous areas in a phenomenon known as “white flight.” The suburbs spread, replacing native ecosystems with miles of pavement and water-guzzling lawns. And their diffuse layout necessitated car travel. American automobile production quadrupled between 1946 and 1955, cementing the nation's dependence on cars. Federal programs like the G.I. Bill offered American veterans favorable lending rates for buying homes. But it was difficult for people of color to take advantage of such resources. Racial covenants restricted them from certain neighborhoods. And, at the same time, government programs labelled neighborhoods of color bad investments and often refused to insure mortgages in those areas. Therefore, banks usually wouldn’t lend money to people purchasing property in neighborhoods of color— a practice that became known as redlining. So, instead of owning homes  that increased in value over time, creating wealth that could be passed to future generations, many people of color were forced to spend their income on rent. And even when they were<i> </i>able  to buy property, their home’s value was less likely to increase. The suburbs boasted cul-de-sacs  and dead ends that minimized traffic. Meanwhile, city planners often identified redlined neighborhoods as inexpensive areas  for industrial development. So, the massive freeway projects  of the mid-20th century disproportionately cut  through redlined neighborhoods, accompanied by heavy industry and pollution. As a result, many neighborhoods of color experience higher rates of drinking water contamination, asthma, and other health issues. People targeted by racial covenants increasingly challenged them in court and, in 1968, they were finally banned under the Fair Housing Act. But the damage had been done. Racial covenants concentrated wealth and amenities in white neighborhoods and depressed the conditions  and home values in neighborhoods of color. As of 2020, about 74% of white families  in the US owned their homes, while about 44% of Black families did. That gap is greatest  in Minnesota’s Twin Cities. Across the country, neighborhoods remain segregated and 90% of all suburban counties are predominantly white. Some landlords, real estate agents, and lenders still discriminate against people  based on race— rejecting them, steering them to and away  from certain neighborhoods, or providing inaccessibly high interest rates. Gentrification and exclusionary  zoning practices also still displace and keep people of color out of certain neighborhoods. Racial covenants are now illegal. But they can still be seen on many housing deeds. The legacy of racial covenants is etched across the pristine lawns of the American suburbs. It’s a footnote in the demographic divides of every city. And it’s one of the insidious architects of the hidden inequalities that shape our world.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 What, you want my milkshake? Here. “It’s 1819. As the United States Congress prepares  to make Missouri the 24th state in the Union, Representative James Tallmage Jr.  delivers a speech. He says slavery is morally wrong, calling it an ‘abomination’ and a ‘monstrous scourge.’ He insists that ‘the extension  of the evil must now be prevented,’ and that slavery shouldn’t be allowed  in Missouri, or any new state.” Obviously. “Representative Tyler disagrees. He believes it is a state’s right  to choose whether or not to allow slavery. He doesn’t think the federal government can prohibit slavery in any newly added states.” Whaaaaat? “Senator Thomas proposes what he sees as a compromise: Missouri will join the union along with another state, Maine. Slavery will be allowed in Missouri and prohibited in Maine. He also suggests drawing a line  through territories yet to become states: slavery will be prohibited north  of the line, and allowed south of it.” And this is where <i>I</i> have to draw the line. That’s better. Now, senators, congressmen, this Missouri compromise you are proposing is fundamentally flawed— flawed is putting it mildly. The compromise is based  on the middle ground fallacy. By saying that half of the new territories should allow slavery while half prohibit it, you position the two viewpoints, pro-slavery and anti-slavery, as equally valid. But if one view is wrong, while the other is right, a compromise between them is still wrong. And one side is definitely wrong here: the pro-slavery side. The whole reason this government exists, the whole reason states exist at all,  is to serve the people. That should include all people. Now, I know there are those  among you who would argue otherwise, even among those in favor of ending slavery. In response to your many contorted arguments, all of them wrong, I offer this reminder: the idea that slavery  is morally indefensible is not new to you. The founders of your country knew it and many even acknowledged it publicly, even those of them who enslaved other people themselves. It’s clear that the errors and delusions on this subject go far beyond the middle ground fallacy, but I call your attention  to this particular fallacy because it can have dire consequences in many situations. Failure to recognize the fact  that a compromise between two positions, one of which is morally indefensible, is also morally indefensible, has helped to perpetuate countless injustices large and small. Even well-intentioned people— which rest assured, I don’t mistake you for— fall prey to this fallacy, because you humans tend to view compromise as a virtue unto itself. “It’s March 1861. Seven states have seceded from the Union since Abraham Lincoln  was elected president. As Lincoln takes office with four more states threatening to leave, he promises not to interfere with slavery in states where it exists, but to prohibit its expansion  into new territories and states.” “It’s April 1861, and a Civil War has broken out over slavery.” Some things can't be resolved with a compromise.\n",

What is also true is that this warm welcome leads to consequences. Problems like housing in these cities are born. Today we have with us a human settlement expert and researcher: Dr. Gautam Bhan, who is re-imagining a solution to this increasing problem. He will share with us the new picture of urban India that he can see. TED Talks India New Thoughts welcomes Dr. Gautam Bhan. Dr. Gautam Bhan, everyone. (Applause) Gautam Bhan: In this country, until a few years ago, if you asked someone: 'Where are you from?' the answer would be Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata. You'd immediately ask again: 'Where do you belong?' Until recently in India, nobody was from a city; people only migrated to the city. This is changing. Urbanization is changing India, but are our cities prepared? Let's assume you were born somewhere else. Your parents worked as laborers all day. Then you too would have come to a city for progress. Or maybe, like it happens today, you were born in the city itself. One day you go out looking for an accommodation in the city, to buy or maybe just to rent. Will you be able find an affordable home? The government says we are falling short of at least 20 million homes. 20 million homes, that's 100 million people. And this is not the shortage of <i>3 BHKs</i> (bedroom hall kitchen). 95 percent of the shortage is for people earning 10 to 15,000 rupees per month. Will you be able to find an affordable home in this budget? If this happened with you, what would you do? Home is not a car or some sort of jewellery. Home is food and clothes. Nobody can live without it. If you couldn't find a home in a city to either buy or rent, you too would be driven to do what most people end up doing. Make a home wherever possible. You too would make a <i>settlement.</i> The government may keep calling it a <i>slum,</i> but like the people living there, I too will call it a settlement. One hundred million are not homeless. They have homes. Homes they built on their own. But most of these homes are in settlements. This is the truth of an affordable home in India. The homes in settlements are cheap, but not sturdy. The homes outside are sturdy, but not cheap. (Applause) We will have to lay the foundation of a new thought from here itself. A settlement is not a problem; it is a solution. We just have to make it secure and sturdy. To fulfill the shortage of 20 million homes you cannot make 20 million 25 square foot flats, and neither should you be making them. For example take the Karnataka government. They have a very good record in this. By 2020, Karnataka needs 2.6 million homes. In the last ten years they have managed to make 350,000 homes. Even if a government tries with complete sincerity, it cannot fulfill this need in the next couple of lifetimes. If we do not make new homes, then what is the next solution? How to make a settlement secure? Firstly, eviction needs to be stopped. Bulldozing needs to be stopped. Never has that resulted in progress in the past, nor will it in the future. (Applause) We have to start believing that the laborers who build and run the city have a right over the land of that city. (Applause) I know you are thinking that settlements are made on illegally captured land, but capturing of land never happens in the dead of the night. Whether the land belongs to the government or not, a settlement is never formed secretly. It is inhabited over time. The government also agrees that the settlements in our cities have been there for over 10, 20, 30, even 40 years. What kind of illegally captured land is this, which was ignored for 30 years and suddenly a day before eviction is declared illegal? A settlement can easily accommodate 15 to 60 percent of a city's population by using just one, two or maximum ten percent of the land. Can such a huge number of people not have a right over this small bit of land? A city's progress is often measured by the cost of its land. How do you ascribe a cost to the life of a person living on a piece of land? A settlement is not asking you for shiny homes; all it's asking for is basic necessities: electricity, roads, water, toilets and drainage. We call this <i>upgradation.</i> Here's an example of upgradation. In Ahmedabad, they started a program where for ten years, 44 settlements were promised there wouldn't be any eviction. Only a promise. Nothing written, no documents. And basic necessities were provided to them. In ten years that slum changed into a locality, a place, a world of its own. The government didn't have to build even a single new home. (Applause) Thailand launched this program at national scale, benefiting 100,000 people in 137 cities. And every person was given the right to live over that land. But pay attention here. Not the right to sell, but the right to live there, use it, settle on it. The whole world knows now that to move forward, we cannot remove settlements. We can only advance when we think of ways to make settlements secure and sturdy. But just one thing. If we know it, then why doesn't it happen? To apply this new thinking to settlements, we, that is you and me, need to look deep within and get rid of the disgust, disrespect and apprehensions that we have. Actually I should not be standing here in front of you today. A person from the settlement who lives there should be standing here. But if someone like that came here, you wouldn't have listened to him. You are listening to me, because you think I am not from a settlement. This is the very thought that needs to be changed. Thank you. (Applause) SRK: Thank you very much. Thank you, Dr. Gautam Bhan. Thanks a lot. Please tell me, you just gave an example of Thailand and the big thing there is the homes are for people to settle in, not to sell. They cannot be used for sale. Is there a similar thought process or program in our country too, inspired by your talks and those of people around you? GB: I wouldn't say by me, but by the people movement who are fighting for rights in the city. That is making a difference. For instance, in Odisha the Chief Minister, Mr. Patnaik, announced the same scheme: that all the people in settlements will have rights over that land. (Applause) And I think this scheme shouldn't be called populism; it should be called an economic development strategy. Because economic development does not happen from the top, but from the bottom. (Applause) SRK: I too promise I will only say settlements, and not slums, ever again. 100 percent. (Applause) Dr. Bhan you came here and said such wonderful things. There is a song. I will not sing it, as I am a terrible singer. GB: I too am a terrible singer. SRK: But we can't keep shut also, because we are saying wonderful things. (laughter) So we will just say it. Slowly the heart will find settlement. GB: Slowly the heart will find settlement. SRK: Only then will life be filled with love and fun times. (Applause) Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Gautam Bhan. Thank you. (Applause) Thank you very much. (Applause)\n",

                                    Many people in the United States and Latin America have grown up celebrating the anniversary of Christopher Columbus's voyage, but was he an intrepid explorer who brought two worlds together or a ruthless exploiter who brought colonialism and slavery? And did he even discover America at all? It's time to put Columbus on the stand in History vs. Christopher Columbus. 'Order, order in the court. Wait, am I even supposed to  be at work today?' <i>Cough</i> 'Yes, your Honor. From 1792, Columbus Day was celebrated in many parts of the United States on October 12th, the actual anniversary date. But although it was declared an official holiday in 1934, individual states aren't required to observe it. Only 23 states close public services, and more states are moving away from it completely.' <i>Cough</i> 'What a pity. In the 70s, we even moved it to the second Monday in October so people could get a nice  three-day weekend, but I guess you folks just hate celebrations.' 'Uh, what are we celebrating again?' 'Come on, Your Honor,  we all learned it in school. Christopher Columbus convinced the King of Spain to send him on a mission to find a better trade route to India, not by going East over land but sailing West around the globe. Everyone said it was crazy because they still thought the world was flat, but he knew better. And when in 1492 he sailed the ocean blue, he found something better than India: a whole new continent.' 'What rubbish. First of all, educated people knew the world was round since Aristotle. Secondly, Columbus didn't  discover anything. There were already people living here for millennia. And he wasn't even  the first European to visit. The Norse had settled Newfoundland almost 500 years before.' 'You don't say, so how come we're not all wearing those cow helmets?' 'Actually, they didn't really  wear those either.' <i>Cough</i> 'Who cares what some Vikings did way back when? Those settlements didn't last, but Columbus's did. And the news he brought back to Europe spread far and wide, inspiring all the explorers and settlers who came after. Without him, none of us  would be here today.' 'And because of him, millions of Native Americans aren't here today. Do you know what Columbus did in the colonies he founded? He took the very first  natives he met prisoner and wrote in his journal about how easily he could conquer and enslave all of them.' 'Oh, come on. Everyone was fighting each other back then. Didn't the natives even tell Columbus about other tribes raiding and taking captives?' 'Yes, but tribal warfare  was sporadic and limited. It certainly didn't wipe out 90% of the population.' 'Hmm. Why is celebrating this Columbus so important to you, anyway?' 'Your Honor, Columbus's voyage  was an inspiration to struggling people all across Europe, symbolizing freedom and new beginnings. And his discovery gave our grandparents and great-grandparents the chance to come here and build better lives for their children. Don't we deserve a hero to remind everyone that our country was build on the struggles of immigrants?' 'And what about the struggles  of Native Americans who were nearly wiped out  and forced into reservations and whose descendants still suffer from poverty and discrimination? How can you make a hero out of a man who caused so much suffering?' 'That's history. You can't judge a guy in the 15th century by modern standards. People back then even thought spreading Christianity and civilization  across the world was a moral duty.' 'Actually, he was pretty bad, even by old standards. While governing Hispaniola, he tortured and mutilated natives who didn't bring him enough gold and sold girls as young as nine into  sexual slavery, and he was brutal even to the other  colonists he ruled, to the point that he was removed  from power and thrown in jail. When the missionary,  Bartolomé de las Casas, visited the island, he wrote, 'From 1494 to 1508, over 3,000,000 people had perished from war, slavery and the mines. Who in  future generations will believe this?'' 'Well, I'm not sure I believe  those numbers.' 'Say, aren't there other ways the holiday is celebrated?' 'In some Latin American countries, they celebrate the same date under different names, such as Día de la Raza. In these places, it's more a celebration of the native and mixed cultures that survived through the colonial period. Some places in the U.S. have also renamed the holiday, as Native American Day or Indigenous People's Day and changed the celebrations accordingly.' 'So, why not just change the name if it's such a problem?' 'Because it's tradition. Ordinary people need their heroes and their founding myths. Can't we just keep celebrating the way we've been doing for a century, without having to delve into all this serious research? It's not like anyone is actually  celebrating genocide.' 'Traditions change, and the way  we choose to keep them alive says a lot about our values.' 'Well, it looks like giving tired judges a day off isn't one of those values, anyway.' Traditions and holidays  are important to all cultures, but a hero in one era may become a villain in the next as our historical knowledge expands and our values evolve. And deciding what these  traditions should mean today is a major part  of putting history on trial.\n",



asked for our opinions. Which team do you think will win the Super Bowl? Who wore it better on the red carpet? Who are you going to vote for for mayor? Public opinion polls are everywhere. Important decision makers in American government have long relied on public opinion polls throughout elections and important legislation. The problem is public opinion isn't easy to track and, often times, isn't even right. In 1948, the <i>Chicago Daily Tribune</i> ran a now famous headline: 'Dewey Defeats Truman,' they cried in big, bold, black and white letters. The problem is that Dewey hadn't defeated Truman. The <i>Tribune</i> had relied on polls to come to their conclusion. Whoops! This happens all the time because public opinion polls are either inaccurate or misleading. So, why are they wrong? And why do we keep using them? First, let's start with an important term: sample. A sample is the group of people that respond to questions during a public opinion poll. A poll's quality rests largely on its sample, and a sample can be bad in a few key ways. It can be too small, too narrow, or the poll itself can be too difficult. Polls that are too small are bad for obvious reasons. And while you can't possibly ask every single person in America for their opinion, the more people you ask, the more accurate your prediction. Polls that are too narrow, that only ask a certain type of person a question, are bad, too. Consider a poll about whether or not the potato is the best vegetable in America. If you only asked people in Idaho, where the state food is the potato, chances are that you would get a much different answer than if you asked people in the state of New Mexico, where the state vegetable is beans. Getting the right kind of diversity in your sample means making sure that your sample has a range of ages, races, genders, and geographic regions, just to name a few. Finally, polls that are too hard can't tell you much either. If you're asking people for their opinions on things about which they have no prior knowledge, the results will be pointless. You're better off shaking a Magic 8 ball. It's not just the people you're asking that can cause bias, though. The person doing the asking is part of the problem, too. That's called interviewer bias. Interviewer bias is all about the effect that the person asking the questions has on the sample. Humans generally don't like confrontation. People worry that their answers may make them look bad. Therefore, we find that people tend to give socially desirable responses, not necessarily their honest opinions, because they don't want to come across as heartless, racist, or bigoted. And the way we word our questions matters too. When polls purposely sway the answers one way or the other, it's called a push poll because it pushes people to answer a certain way. 'Would you vote for candidate Smith?' is a perfectly normal question. 'Would you vote for candidate Smith if you knew that he robs senior citizens?' is a push poll. So, if polls are open to all sorts of manipulation and inaccuracies, why are they still so prevalent? Despite their flaws, public opinion polls provide us with some sense of the thoughts and moods of large groups of people. They offer politicians the chance to pass legislation they think a majority of Americans will support. They help fashionistas on TV know which star wore the dress better on the red carpet. Finally, they make us, the people who get polled, feel as though our voice has been heard. So, next time you get a phone call asking your opinion, or if you see a poll online, take some time to think about who is asking and why they're asking. Then, take that poll, and its results, with a grain of salt or a potato.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The ancient Greeks had a great idea: The universe is simple. In their minds, all you needed to make it were four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. As theories go, it's a beautiful one. It has simplicity and elegance.  It says that by combining the four basic elements in different ways, you could produce all the wonderful diversity of the universe. Earth and fire, for example, give you things that are dry. Air and water, things that are wet. But as theories go, it had a problem. It didn't predict anything that could be measured, and measurement is the basis of experimental science. Worse still, the theory was wrong. But the Greeks were great scientists of the mind and in the 5th century B.C., Leucippus of Miletus came up with one of the most enduring scientific ideas ever. Everything we see is made up of tiny, indivisible bits of stuff called atoms. This theory is simple and elegant, and it has the advantage over the earth, air, fire, and water theory of being right. Centuries of scientific thought and experimentation have established that the real elements, things like hydrogen, carbon, and iron, can be broken down into atoms. In Leucippus's theory, the atom is the smallest, indivisible bit of stuff that's still recognizable as hydrogen, carbon, or iron. The only thing wrong with Leucippus's idea is that atoms are, in fact, divisible. Furthermore, his atoms idea turns out to explain just a small part of what the universe is made of. What appears to be the ordinary stuff of the universe is, in fact, quite rare. Leucippus's atoms, and the things they're made of, actually make up only about 5% of what we know to be there. Physicists know the rest of the universe, 95% of it, as the dark universe, made of dark matter and dark energy. How do we know this? Well, we know because we look at things and we see them. That might seem rather simplistic, but it's actually quite profound. All the stuff that's made of atoms is visible. Light bounces off it, and we can see it. When we look out into space, we see stars and galaxies. Some of them, like the one we live in, are beautiful, spiral shapes, spinning gracefully through space. When scientists first measured the motion of groups of galaxies in the 1930's and weighed the amount of matter they contained, they were in for a surprise. They found that there's not enough visible stuff in those groups to hold them together. Later measurements of individual galaxies confirmed this puzzling result. There's simply not enough visible stuff in galaxies to provide enough gravity to hold them together. From what we can see, they ought to fly apart, but they don't. So there must be stuff there that we can't see. We call that stuff dark matter. The best evidence for dark matter today comes from measurements of something called the cosmic microwave background, the afterglow of the Big Bang, but that's another story. All of the evidence we have says that dark matter is there and it accounts for much of the stuff in those beautiful spiral galaxies that fill the heavens. So where does that leave us? We've long known that the heavens do not revolve around us and that we're residents of a fairly ordinary planet, orbiting a fairly ordinary star, in the spiral arm of a fairly ordinary galaxy. The discovery of dark matter took us one step further away from the center of things. It told us that the stuff we're made of is only a small fraction of what makes up the universe. But there was more to come. Early this century, scientists studying the outer reaches of the universe confirmed that not only is everything moving apart from everything else, as you would expect in a universe that began in hot, dense big bang, but that the universe's expansion also seems to be accelerating. What's that about? Either there is some kind of energy pushing this acceleration, just like you provide energy to accelerate a car, or gravity does not behave exactly as we think. Most scientists think it's the former, that there's some kind of energy driving the acceleration, and they called it <i>dark energy</i>. Today's best measurements allow us to work out just how much of the universe is dark. It looks as if dark energy makes up about 68% of the universe and dark matter about 27%, leaving just 5% for us and everything else we can actually see. So what's the dark stuff made of? We don't know, but there's one theory, called <i>supersymmetry</i>, that could explain some of it. Supersymmetry, or SUSY for short, predicts a whole range of new particles, some of which could make up the dark matter. If we found evidence for SUSY, we could go from understanding 5% of our universe, the things we can actually see, to around a third. Not bad for a day's work. Dark energy would probably be harder to understand, but there are some speculative theories out there that might point the way. Among them are theories that go back to that first great idea of the ancient Greeks, the idea that we began with several minutes ago, the idea that the universe must be simple. These theories predict that there is just a single element from which all the universe's wonderful diversity stems, a vibrating string. The idea is that all the particles we know today are just different harmonics on the string. Unfortunately, string theories today are, as yet, untestable. But, with so much of the universe waiting to be explored, the stakes are high. Does all of this make you feel small? It shouldn't. Instead, you should marvel in the fact that, as far as we know, you are a member of the only species in the universe able even to begin to grasp its wonders, and you're living at the right time to see our understanding explode.\n",

Or, more precisely, can energy be made into matter? Yes, but only when it comes together with its twin, antimatter. And there's something pretty mysterious about antimatter: there's way less of it out there than there should be. Let's start with the most famous physics formula ever: E equals m c squared. It basically says that mass is concentrated energy, and mass and energy are exchangeable, like two currencies with a huge exchange rate. 90 trillion Joules of energy are equivalent to 1 gram of mass. But how do I actually transform energy into matter? The magic word is <i>energy density</i>. If you concentrate a huge amount of energy in a tiny space, new particles will come into existence. If we look closer, we see that these particles always come in pairs, like twins. That's because particles always have a counterpart, an antiparticle, and these are always produced in exactly equal amounts: 50/50. This might sound like science fiction, but it's the daily life of particle accelerators. In the collisions between two protons at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, billions of particles and antiparticles are produced every second. Consider, for example, the electron. It has a very small mass and negative electric charge. It's antiparticle, the positron, has exactly the same mass, but a positive electric charge. But, apart from the opposite charges, both particles are identical and perfectly stable. And the same is true for their heavy cousins, the proton and the antiproton. Therefore, scientists are convinced that a world made of antimatter would look, feel, and smell just like our world. In this antiworld, we may find antiwater, antigold, and, for example, an antimarble. Now imagine that a marble and an antimarble are brought together. These two apparently solid objects would completely disappear into a big flash of energy, equivalent to an atomic bomb. Because combining matter and antimatter would create so much energy, science fiction is full of ideas about harnessing the energy stored in antimatter, for example, to fuel spaceships like Star Trek. After all, the energy content of antimatter is a billion times higher than conventional fuel. The energy of one gram of antimatter would be enough for driving a car 1,000 times around the Earth, or to bring the space shuttle into orbit. So why don't we use antimatter for energy production? Well, antimatter isn't just sitting around, ready for us to harvest. We have to make antimatter before we can combust antimatter, and it takes a billion times more energy to make antimatter than you get back. But, what if there was some antimatter in outer space and we could dig it out one day from an antiplanet somewhere. A few decades ago, many scientists believed that this could actually be possible. Today, observations have shown that there is no significant amount of antimatter anywhere in the visible universe, which is weird because, like we said before, there should be just as much antimatter as there is matter in the universe. Since antiparticles and particles should exist in equal numbers, this missing antimatter? Now that is a real mystery. To understand what might be happening, we must go back to the Big Bang. In the instant the universe was created, a huge amount of energy was transformed into mass, and our initial universe contained equal amounts of matter and antimatter. But just a second later, most matter and all of the antimatter had destroyed one another, producing an enormous amount of radiation that can still be observed today. Just about 100 millionths of the original amount of matter stuck around and no antimatter whatsoever. 'Now, wait!' you might say, 'Why did all the antimatter disappear and only matter was left?' It seems that we were somehow lucky that a tiny asymmetry exists between matter and antimatter. Otherwise, there would be no particles at all anywhere in the universe and also no human beings. But what causes this asymmetry? Experiments at CERN are trying to find out the reason why something exists and why we don't live in a universe filled with radiation only? But, so far, we just don't know the answer.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    People often think the word 'doubt' spelling is a little crazy because of the letter 'b'. Since it doesn't spell a sound, most folks can't figure out what it's doing there. But in spite of what most of us learn in school, sound is <i>never</i> the most important aspect of spelling an English word. A word's meaning and history need to come first. To doubt means to question, to waver, to hesitate. As a noun, it means uncertainty or confusion. The present-day English word 'doubt' started as a Latin word, 'dubitare'. It first moved from Latin into French where it lost both its 'buh' sound and its letter 'b'. And then it came into English in the 13th century. About 100 years later, scribes who wrote English but also knew Latin, started to reinsert the 'b' into the word's spelling, even though no one pronounced it that way. But why would they do this? Why would anyone in their right mind reinsert a silent letter into a spelling? Well, because they knew Latin, the scribes understood that the root of 'doubt' had a 'b' in it. Over time, even as fewer literate people knew Latin, the 'b' was kept because it marked important, meaningful connections to other related words, like 'dubious' and 'indubitalbly,' which were subsequently borrowed into English from the same Latin root, 'dubitare'. Understanding these historical connections not only helped us to spell 'doubt,' but also to understand the meaning of these more sophisticated words. But the story doesn't end there. If we look even deeper, we can see beyond the shadow of a doubt, just how revealing that 'b' can be. There are only two base words in all of English that have the letters 'd-o-u-b': one is doubt, and the other is double. We can build lots of other words on each of these bases, like doubtful and doubtless, or doublet, and redouble, and doubloon. It turns out that if we look into their history, we can see that they both derive from the same Latin forms. The meaning of double, two, is reflected in a deep understanding of doubt. See, when we doubt, when we hesitate, we second guess ourselves. When we have doubts about something, when we have questions or confusion, we are of two minds. Historically, before English began to borrow words from French, it already had a word for doubt. That Old English word was 'tweogan,' a word whose relationship to 'two' is clear in its spelling as well. So the next time you are in doubt about why English spelling works the way it does, take a second look. What you find just might make you do a double-take.\n",

So most everyone watches TV. We like it. We like some parts of it. Here in America, people actually love TV. The average American watches TV for almost 5 hours a day. Okay? Now I happen to make my living these days in television, so for me, that's a good thing. But a lot of people don't love it so much. They, in fact, berate it. They call it stupid, and worse, believe me. My mother, growing up, she called it the 'idiot box.' But my idea today is not to debate whether there's such a thing as good TV or bad TV; my idea today is to tell you that I believe television has a conscience. So why I believe that television has a conscience is that I actually believe that television directly reflects the moral, political, social and emotional need states of our nation -- that television is how we actually disseminate our entire value system. So all these things are uniquely human, and they all add up to our idea of conscience. Now today, we're not talking about good and bad TV. We're talking about popular TV. We're talking about top-10 Nielsen-rated shows over the course of 50 years. How do these Nielsen ratings reflect not just what you've heard about, which is the idea of our social, collective unconscious, but how do these top-10 Nielsen-rated shows over 50 years reflect the idea of our social conscience? How does television evolve over time, and what does this say about our society? Now speaking of evolution, from basic biology, you probably remember that the animal kingdom, including humans, have four basic primal instincts. You have hunger; you have sex; you have power; and you have the urge for acquisitiveness. As humans, what's important to remember is that we've developed, we've evolved over time to temper, or tame, these basic animal instincts. We have the capacity to laugh and cry. We feel awe, we feel pity. That is separate and apart from the animal kingdom. The other thing about human beings is that we love to be entertained. We love to watch TV. This is something that clearly separates us from the animal kingdom. Animals might love to play, but they don't love to watch. So I had an ambition to discover what could be understood from this uniquely human relationship between television programs and the human conscious. Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has? I kind of think of it as this cartoon devil or angel sitting on our shoulders. Is television literally functioning as our conscience, tempting us and rewarding us at the same time? So to begin to answer these questions, we did a research study. We went back 50 years to the 1959/1960 television season. We surveyed the top-20 Nielsen shows every year for 50 years -- a thousand shows. We talked to over 3,000 individuals -- almost 3,600 -- aged 18 to 70, and we asked them how they felt emotionally. How did you feel watching every single one of these shows? Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity? Did you feel outrage? Did you laugh? What did this mean for you? So to our global TED audiences, I want to say that this was a U.S. sample. But as you can see, these emotional need states are truly universal. And on a factual basis, over 80 percent of the U.S.'s most popular shows are exported around the world. So I really hope our global audiences can relate. Two acknowledgments before our first data slide: For inspiring me to even think about the idea of conscience and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis, I thank legendary rabbi, Jack Stern. And for the way in which I'm going to present the data, I want to thank TED community superstar Hans Rosling, who you may have just seen. Okay, here we go. So here you see, from 1960 to 2010, the 50 years of our study. Two things we're going to start with -- the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state, which, for this purpose, we defined inspiration as television shows that uplift me, that make me feel much more positive about the world. Moral ambiguity are televisions shows in which I don't understand the difference between right and wrong. As we start, you see in 1960 inspiration is holding steady. That's what we're watching TV for. Moral ambiguity starts to climb. Right at the end of the 60s, moral ambiguity is going up, inspiration is kind of on the wane. Why? The Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK is shot, the Civil Rights movement, race riots, the Vietnam War, MLK is shot, Bobby Kennedy is shot, Watergate. Look what happens. In 1970, inspiration plummets. Moral ambiguity takes off. They cross, but Ronald Reagan, a telegenic president, is in office. It's trying to recover. But look, it can't: AIDS, Iran-Contra, the Challenger disaster, Chernobyl. Moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television from 1990 for the next 20 years. Take a look at this. This chart is going to document a very similar trend. But in this case, we have comfort -- the bubble in red -- social commentary and irreverence in blue and green. Now this time on TV you have 'Bonanza,' don't forget, you have 'Gunsmoke,' you have 'Andy Griffith,' you have domestic shows all about comfort. This is rising. Comfort stays whole. Irreverence starts to rise. Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up. You get to 1969, and look what happens. You have comfort, irreverence, and social commentary, not only battling it out in our society, but you literally have two establishment shows -- 'Gunsmoke' and 'Gomer Pyle' -- in 1969 are the number-two- and number-three-rated television shows. What's number one? The socially irreverent hippie show, 'Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In.' They're all living together, right. Viewers had responded dramatically. Look at this green spike in 1966 to a bellwether show. When you guys hear this industry term, a breakout hit, what does that mean? It means in the 1966 television season, The 'Smothers Brothers' came out of nowhere. This was the first show that allowed viewers to say, 'My God, I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War, about the presidency, through television?' That's what we mean by a breakout show. So then, just like the last chart, look what happens. In 1970, the dam bursts. The dam bursts. Comfort is no longer why we watch television. Social commentary and irreverence rise throughout the 70s. Now look at this. The 70s means who? Norman Lear. You have 'All in the Family,' 'Sanford and Son,' and the dominant show -- in the top-10 for the entire 70s -- 'M<i>A</i>S*H.' In the entire 50 years of television that we studied, seven of 10 shows ranked most highly for irreverence appeared on air during the Vietnam War, five of the top-10 during the Nixon administration. Only one generation, 20 years in, and we discovered, Wow! TV can do that? It can make me feel this? It can change us? So to this very, very savvy crowd, I also want to note the digital folks did not invent disruptive. Archie Bunker was shoved out of his easy chair along with the rest of us 40 years ago. This is a quick chart. Here's another attribute: fantasy and imagination, which are shows defined as, 'takes me out of my everyday realm' and 'makes me feel better.' That's mapped against the red dot, unemployment, which is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic. You'll see that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise, it maps to a spike in unemployment. Do we want to see shows about people saving money and being unemployed? No. In the 70s you have the bellwether show 'The Bionic Woman' that rocketed into the top-10 in 1973, followed by the 'Six Million-Dollar Man' and 'Charlie's Angels.' Another spike in the 1980s -- another spike in shows about control and power. What were those shows? Glamorous and rich. 'Dallas,' 'Fantasy Island.' Incredible mapping of our national psyche with some hard and fast facts: unemployment. So here you are, in my favorite chart, because this is our last 20 years. Whether or not you're in my business, you have surely heard or read of the decline of the thing called the three-camera sitcom and the rise of reality TV. Well, as we say in the business, X marks the spot. The 90s -- the big bubbles of humor -- we're watching 'Friends,' 'Frasier,' 'Cheers' and 'Seinfeld.' Everything's good, low unemployment. But look: X marks the spot. In 2001, the September 2001 television season, humor succumbs to judgment once and for all. Why not? We had a 2000 presidential election decided by the Supreme Court. We had the bursting of the tech bubble. We had 9/11. Anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon. Look what happens when we keep going. At the turn of the century, the Internet takes off, reality television has taken hold. What do people want in their TV then? I would have thought revenge or nostalgia. Give me some comfort; my world is falling apart. No, they want judgment. I can vote you off the island. I can keep Sarah Palin's daughter dancing. I can choose the next American Idol. You're fired. That's all great, right? So as dramatically different as these television shows, pure entertainment, have been over the last 50 years -- what did I start with? -- one basic instinct remains. We're animals, we need our moms. There has not been a decade of television without a definitive, dominant TV mom. The 1950s: June Cleever in the original comfort show, 'Leave it to Beaver.' Lucille Ball kept us laughing through the rise of social consciousness in the 60s. Maude Findlay, the epitome of the irreverent 1970s, who tackled abortion, divorce, even menopause on TV. The 1980s, our first cougar was given to us in the form of Alexis Carrington. Murphy Brown took on a vice president when she took on the idea of single parenthood. This era's mom, Bree Van de Kamp. Now I don't know if this is the devil or the angel sitting on our conscience, sitting on television's shoulders, but I do know that I absolutely love this image. So to you all, the women of TEDWomen, the men of TEDWomen, the global audiences of TEDWomen, thank you for letting me present my idea about the conscience of television. But let me also thank the incredible creators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television screens throughout all these ages of television. They give it life on television, for sure, but it's you as viewers, through your collective social consciences, that give it life, longevity, power or not. So thanks very much. (Applause)\n",
