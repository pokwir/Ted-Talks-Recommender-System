       "      <td>Hello, I am Machine Dazzle, and I am an emotionally-driven, instinct-based conceptual artist, designer and musician. Today I&amp;apos;m going to talk about the power of transformation through the sacred ritual of costume. With the help of my friend Matty Crosland. Matty? Oh, hey, girl. (Laughs) Matty is going to hand out a few seeds of possibility while I continue. Growing up in Middle America, I wasn&amp;apos;t allowed to be who I was. I was discouraged from a career in the arts. When we went to the toy store, my two brothers would run to the black and blue aisle and I would run to the pink aisle. There was a lot of shame surrounding my preference for &amp;quot;girls&amp;apos;&amp;quot; toys. I shoplifted my first Barbie. Desperate people do desperate things. But what was really happening during that time is I was building up a massive reserve of ideas, unrealized desires and dreams. And when I bought that one-way ticket to New York, which is the first decision I ever truly made for myself, I brought with me that reserve of unrealized dreams, desires and ideas. And that&amp;apos;s when I really started to take risks. And I learned about the power of transformation, starting with becoming my true self. In 2019, I was commissioned by Guggenheim Works and Process to do a show. I knew immediately that I wanted to make a show about my mother, Deborah. Here she is, printed on my dress. It was the &amp;apos;60s, the bouffant, the cat-eye frames. Maybe some of you remember. Sadly, I lost my mother in 1996 to cancer. So in her honor, I created a rock and roll cabaret. It features songs that I wrote and sang about her, my relationship with her and my self-actualization. It is called &amp;quot;Treasure,&amp;quot; and you can listen to it on your favorite streaming service. In fact, I just released the first dance track from it. It&amp;apos;s called &amp;quot;Understand,&amp;quot; and if you like to wiggle your peach, then you should look it up. (Laughter) My opening outfit, I created this big &amp;apos;60s bouffant. It is made out of about 2,500 metallic pipe cleaners. Why pipe cleaners? Because wigs are common. And I like to challenge existing systems and take risks. And it is actually quite heavy. Transformation takes commitment. Did I mention that my work is maximal? We are complex beings. We exist in many layers. Speaking of layers, then I added this swing coat. It&amp;apos;s made out of an old American flag camouflaged in paint, dye and adorned with flowers. Flowers that I found in the dumpster at the cemetery where my mother&amp;apos;s ashes are buried. Yes, people take fake flowers off of the graves, throw them into the dumpster to put new fake flowers on the graves. I thought it was appropriate. And so there it is, a source of protection. On stage, I became not my mother, that wasn&amp;apos;t the point. I became a higher version of myself. Not man, not woman. Something other. In this show, I&amp;apos;m hoping to realize all of my dreams and not just mine, but all of my mother&amp;apos;s, too, because she had them. More is more. One of my -- yes, I wish you could all have them, but you know how it is. (Laughter) Pom pom on head, look at that. One of my most maximal projects to date is with my favorite collaborator, Taylor Mac. Together with hundreds of others, we created a 24-hour show. It is called &amp;quot;24 Decades: A History of Popular Music.&amp;quot; It premiered in Brooklyn at St. Ann’s Warehouse in 2016. It&amp;apos;s a 24-hour show. It starts in 1776 and goes to the present day. Every hour of the show is dedicated to a different decade in American history. For every decade, I created a costume that is conceptually adjacent, not historically accurate. Why? Because traditional historical costume already exists, conceptually and otherwise. And I like to break traditions and invent new ones. And when you break an egg, there are countless ways to turn it into something delicious. So it’s high noon in Brooklyn at St. Ann’s Warehouse. It&amp;apos;s the top of the show in 1776, right after we freed ourselves from the British in the United States. And inspiration came when I was walking in Brooklyn, where I live. I was passing this laundromat. What were they doing? They were taking down these old, plastic, grand-opening flags. What were they doing? They were putting up new plastic, grand-opening flags. Well, I snatched them out of the garbage because, you know, and I noticed how weather-worn and brittle and fragile they were. And I got to thinking about the end of the American Revolution and how tattered and torn and broken everything must have been. And then it hit me. This costume wants to tell a story. An illegitimate child of colonialism ran away from home to New Orleans and opened the laundromat called Lou Washery, and they are celebrating the Grand Overture as the official, unofficial cheerleader of the original 13 colonies. This is maximalism. Not only is it layer upon layer aesthetically, it&amp;apos;s idea on top of idea conceptually. It becomes its own story, almost that you can almost read like a book. Well, if history has taught us anything, it&amp;apos;s that things change. Here we are an hour later in the show, and it&amp;apos;s time for a costume change. An apple pie as a headdress. The care and the craft and the smell of home. And I put two pipes on Taylor&amp;apos;s back, upholstered in a colonial fabric, steam was coming out of them at the top of that decade. But you know how it is. And they represent the invention of the steam engine, which gave way to westward expansion, for better or for worse. And then I thought, well, what else was happening? Well, George Washington was president at the time, and I was always kind of into his little cherry tree story of virtue. You know, &amp;quot;I cannot tell a lie, I chopped down that cherry tree.&amp;quot; And it was the French Revolution across the pond and the guillotine was like, full on. So I was like, &amp;quot;Well, why don&amp;apos;t I combine them together?&amp;quot; And, oh, you know, severed heads in cherry tree drag as garment. What I&amp;apos;m getting at is, the costume can be so much more than the costume. It can be the props, it can be the set, it can tell its own stories, it can even be its own character. It can be all of it at the same time. This kind of maximalism leaves an audience completely satisfied, yet wanting more at the same time. More is more. Well, wouldn’t you know, now it’s 7pm at night, and it&amp;apos;s time for the Civil War. I took two distinct inventions from this time to help tell this story. I read somewhere once that the American hot dog evolved out of German immigrants selling their bratwurst and rolls on the streets during the 1860s. Well, I like that. And then this distinctive barbed wire, you know, barbed wire, a symbol of separation, security, insecurity. Well, I wanted to combine the two together. In this way of making things, I bring order to disorder. By turning barbed wire into hot dogs, what I&amp;apos;m trying to do, hopefully, is eat through what is separating us, in this case, slavery. When you believe in something that is marginalized and goes against the mainstream of society, it is so important that you do it big, bold, brave and unapologetically, truly. OK, well, here we are after the war again. It’s time for Reconstruction. And, you know, how about the invention of the typewriter? I love the way this piece wiggles as Taylor clicks across the stage. And then the introduction of dynamite and toilet paper on rolls, how domestic! Well, I took those empty toilet paper rolls, and I painted them to look like sticks of dynamite and boom -- headdress, hello. You know, why not? Well, here we are. Now, we&amp;apos;ve been performing all night. We&amp;apos;re tired. It’s 10am. It&amp;apos;s the 1980s. Just in time for the AIDS pandemic. Taylor wears two white, high-heeled shoes sprinkled with little green pom poms. They look like clown shoes, but they represent the white blood cells being attacked by HIV. This collaboration, this &amp;quot;24-Decade History of Popular Music,&amp;quot; took maximalism and &amp;quot;more is more&amp;quot; to a whole new level. I have to say, through the music, the storytelling and the transformative nature of the costumes, we changed the course of queer history. And if nothing else, it sure is fun to pull an all-nighter with 24 costume changes. Well, here we are. This is an image of me on the streets of New York City at the Easter Bonnet Parade several years ago. I am a fan of taking my art to the streets. But I have to tell you, it takes a little bit of courage to dress like this in public, particularly these days. Just about every part of my creative ethos is under attack in the United States right now. On first glance, you might see an over-the-top outfit on a Sunday, in black and white and pink. But upon closer inspection, you&amp;apos;ll see the details, the skull peeking out, the skeletal hand creeping out of the innocent plush animals on my head. I once had my Easter bonnet ripped right off of my head in front of St. Patrick&amp;apos;s Cathedral. Not this one. I don&amp;apos;t think they would dare. Sometimes, I think that life is about overcoming all of your greatest fears. Life itself is how you go about that. I go all the way. I do the work. There is no happiness that I know unless I am risking something. The only true happiness that I know comes from this sense of accomplishment, by taking the risk. Well, here I am again on the streets of New York, this time for the Reclaim Pride March back in 2019 again. A good friend gave me really good advice once. &amp;quot;Machine, it&amp;apos;s never too early to be pre-revolutionary, and it&amp;apos;s never too late to be post-apocalyptic chic.&amp;quot; (Laughter) Sometimes this course of action, this transformation, is the most honest action that you can take. You owe yourself honesty. I consider it a prayer. Today, after all, is a placeholder for what&amp;apos;s coming tomorrow. By becoming other, you avoid labels. You can change someone&amp;apos;s life just by walking across the room because you are changing what is possible in their minds. Be more. You will get more out of life. And not just for you, for everyone around you. I&amp;apos;m telling you, that is the Gospel truth. Another thing I wanted to say, this collective land of make-believe that we are in right now, this is very fertile, very creative space where anything is possible. Matty, let&amp;apos;s bring it home.

       "      <td>Can you paint with all the colors of the wind? I love this song from the first time I heard it. I was 14, growing up in public housing in western Sydney. So maybe a little too old for this Disney classic from &amp;quot;Pocahontas.&amp;quot; But it spoke to me. I saw something of myself in it. At this stage, I think I knew I was queer. I mean, come on, I was rocking out to Disney. (Laughter) And look at those glasses. (Laughter) Seriously, what a queer kid. (Laughter) But I was also from a Pacific Indigenous heritage with conservative views and values. I didn&amp;apos;t feel like I could fit into any of the boxes that were being presented to me. Straight, gay, Fijian, Australian. I couldn&amp;apos;t pick just one color to paint with. Prior to colonization, sexuality amongst many of our Pacific islands across the region was fluid. Men would have sex with men without the stigma or shame afforded it today. Sexual intimacy was a way of being able to connect socially and relationally. Sex wasn&amp;apos;t just for procreation. Or in marriage. It wasn&amp;apos;t exclusively monogamous. Just because you had sex with a man didn&amp;apos;t define your sexuality. It didn&amp;apos;t make you an outcast. But as Europeans started to colonize the Pacific region, they brought Christian missionaries with them. They told us to cover up our beautiful bodies. We were taught shame. We were told to stop practicing Pacifica cultures and values that were seen as provocative. To a Western and white perspective, our non-binary sexuality was judged as tribal, outdated, sinful and impossible to practice alongside a Christian faith. Still today, those who are Indigenous to the Pacific are negatively impacted by whiteness. That “white is right, West is best.” I was brought up to espouse strong Christian beliefs, views and values which would shape my burgeoning identity as an adult. From these staunch conservative views, I was taught to fear the queer. Those people that were seen as unusual and fruity. And in essence, I grew to despise a part of myself. I sought to separate my queerness from my identity. I could never see myself as part of that world. Growing up, biracial and bisexual constantly challenged the way I saw the world around me. I was unsure about my thinking, feelings and behaviors around liking males and females. I was unsure about my thinking, feelings and behaviors when it came to whether I needed to be a white Australian or a Fijian person. And whether this needed to be framed within a binary to choose one over the other. In this way, I don&amp;apos;t think that my story is unique. There&amp;apos;s plenty of people in the queer world that have escaped conservative upbringings, religions and cultures. But this is only part of my story. Another common story in the queer community is the coming-out story. When did you tell your parents? How did they react? How it liberated you or ultimately separated you from your family. But this didn&amp;apos;t feel like an option for me either. I believe that embedded in these particular stories, these tropes, is a part of dominant queer culture that made it very hard for me to access the queer world. For example, when I started to go to gay clubs, I would be lining up at the front of the club and often I would get door staff come up to me and go, &amp;quot;Sorry, you do know this is a gay club, right?&amp;quot; From these lived experiences, I feel that there is a whiteness that pervades queer culture. And I didn&amp;apos;t want to give up my identity and my appearance as a Pacific indigenous person to be queer. Pacifica cultures really, really value and esteem the collective above the individual. For Pacifica people, our families are inextricably connected to our own sense of self-agency, self-determination, self-esteem, self-love and self-worth. Our own individual identities are meshed and intertwined with our family&amp;apos;s reputation and standing in the community. Our mind, body and souls are inextricably connected to the broader community, to our families, to ourselves and to others. I didn&amp;apos;t want to come out to potentially ostracize myself, to make a point to separate myself from my Pacific and faith communities. I couldn&amp;apos;t then see my authentic self in any of these spaces. And a quick shout out to my son on the left-hand side. Round of applause for my son. (Laughs) (Applause) He said to me this morning, &amp;quot;Daddy, make sure you mention me.&amp;quot; So I was like, &amp;quot;OK, son. Alright.&amp;quot; So there you go for the recording, son. And the rest are my other family, that&amp;apos;s up there as well. Across queer cultures and the broader community, we have learned to embrace our gender and sexual differences. We encourage individuals to be allies for each other and to support safe spaces for those that are seen to not fit in. We empower and really encourage individuals to really develop and express their self-agency, their self-determination, their self love, their self-worth. We boldly go into spaces striving to bring others with us to ensure that we can create inclusive societies for everyone. However, the dominant Western view in queer cultures is still based on the individual. Me, myself and I. And my individual pursuits towards happiness. As a queer Indigenous Pacific person, I feel that there are parts of queer culture that is white, feels very white. We may fail to see the importance of bringing our families and our cultural communities along our journey as queer people. It&amp;apos;s either the queer way or the highway. It&amp;apos;s one or the other. Young or old. Rich or poor. Smart or stupid. Masculine or feminine. Fit or fat. These binaries create a sense of us and them, those people. A binary approach and position that we generally in Western white societies use to determine the norm. We create, conflate, perpetuate binaries that create divisions in our society. Saints or sinner, straight or gay. I see it like this. Binaries are a very white and Western way of thinking, feeling and behaving. As individuals today, we live within these binaries and create identities that then create these labels. We use these labels to then define and confine people and places. We are one or the other. But what we fail to see is that our identities are more than a set of binaries. Our own identities are comprised of intersecting identifiers that contributes to who you are, including our age, class, color, education, gender, size, spirituality, sexuality, and so, so much more. We need to decolonize queerness, to live beyond “white is right, West is best.” Because if we don&amp;apos;t, we&amp;apos;re going to continue to create silos and divisions in our societies that don&amp;apos;t create inclusive and safe spaces for everyone. For Indigenous queer people, they shape our connection to community and culture, our families. If we don&amp;apos;t include that within our understanding of who we are, even as queer people, then we&amp;apos;re not able to be, again, our true and authentic selves. We&amp;apos;re not able to then be our fabulous selves as part of the queer community. And it&amp;apos;s really, really interesting because I believe that we can learn so much from pre-colonial cultures like those that were practiced in the Pacific, that provide a different way of looking at a society. A queer way that pre-dates all the privileges that go into binary ways of thinking, feeling and behaving. Across many of our Pacifica languages we have a lot of key concepts that help solidify and support a shared understanding of the collective. For example, in Fijian, &amp;quot;solesolevaki&amp;quot; is all about reciprocal living, where my wellbeing is your wellbeing. I will actively seek to ensure that your well-being and every part of your life is catered for, knowing that you will do the same for me. We strive to enact “veiqaravi,” as tatted here on my hand, to serve others. We strive to also embed and embold and empower people to practice &amp;quot;veirokovi,&amp;quot; respect for self and others where we are relationally driven, where that is so important to our spaces and places. My sense of ability to actually put this into practice, my ability to actually understand these Indigenous perspectives has greatly helped shape and reconcile my queer identity today. But what&amp;apos;s really interesting is that it&amp;apos;s not just queer communities that need to decolonize itself. It&amp;apos;s all of us as a broader society that needs to be part of a shared conversation to decolonize, deconstruct and disrupt binary ways of thinking, feeling and behaving. So how can we practically do that? Practice cultural humility, where you are constantly learning and embracing differences, where you get over yourselves and strive to learn about other people&amp;apos;s differences and how that can be meaningfully included in the way in which you create safe spaces for everyone. I also believe it&amp;apos;s possible to bring Indigenous perspectives into Western and white workplaces. For example, I’ve introduced the concept of “talanoa” in all of my work meetings. Talanoa is all about being able to create a safe space where everyone is able to contribute to a collective, collegial and collaborative conversation. Where people are able to bring their authentic selves into these spaces. Literally, I will chair meetings where I have no firm set agenda items and I literally would just hold space for participants just to bring themselves. So you can tell I&amp;apos;m a social worker, right? (Laughter) Safe space, safe space, safe space. It&amp;apos;s OK, it&amp;apos;s OK. But it&amp;apos;s through these safe spaces that people can bring their multiple, intersecting identifiers, including their age, their class, color, education, gender, size, spirituality, sexuality and so, so much more. I invite queer communities to come talanoa with Pacific Indigenous Communities to create robust and resilient queer cultures. I have been able to greatly reconcile my queer and Pacifica identities, which has now really been embraced to help shape how I see the world around me today. And it&amp;apos;s through these shared perspectives and approaches that we can truly embrace cultural diversity and its differences. And to know that people can live beyond those binaries and those labels we continue to perpetuate and perpetrate against others. It is a commitment from queer communities to decolonize queerness. It&amp;apos;s a commitment from me, from you and all of us to decolonize Western and white societies and to live beyond the binary way of thinking, feeling and behaving. I genuinely believe that it&amp;apos;s through this common goal that we can truly learn how to paint with all the colors of the wind. “Vinaka vakalevu” and thank you.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I spent my whole career in the nonprofit sector. Street outreach, program management, fundraising, grant making, public policy, you name it, I&amp;apos;ve done it. I&amp;apos;ve seen a lot. And I&amp;apos;m a really positive person, so it&amp;apos;s actually difficult to say this. But the way we do philanthropy right now, the way we&amp;apos;ve done it for decades, is broken. And here&amp;apos;s how I found out. In my early 20s, I was a frontline social worker in New York City, working with people living with HIV. Many of them had multiple chronic illnesses, and they were underhoused. So I&amp;apos;d spend my days, and even some nights, with them, running around the city to doctor&amp;apos;s appointments and housing agencies. The day-to-day work was hard. But the hardest part was we never had had enough funding to do the work. On Friday mornings, I&amp;apos;d go into the office to write up my case notes for the week and I&amp;apos;d speed past front reception, not looking at the mailboxes full of blue slips. Each blue letter marked another colleague let go because of our funding crisis. Within one month, I’d lost half my team, and my caseload ballooned from 30 to over 100. And this is the reality for so many nonprofits. They&amp;apos;re at the mercy of their funders. And when we look at those funders, they decide who and what gets funded. And it&amp;apos;s almost always a mystery how they make those decisions. Nonprofits spend so much time fundraising, filling out pages and pages and pages of paperwork. And they&amp;apos;re filling out so much paperwork that they hardly have any time to actually support communities, which is literally the thing that they&amp;apos;re funded to do. After years of doing amazing work, improving every single metric, we&amp;apos;d hear things like, &amp;quot;I&amp;apos;m sorry, our major donor has switched direction. They’re no longer working and investing in HIV and AIDS.” Or, “I’m sorry, we issue grants for three years max.&amp;quot; This would never happen in the private sector. You do an amazing job for three years and then get fired? It makes no sense. So I decided to switch sides. Instead of being on the side that&amp;apos;s asking for money, what if I went to the side that was giving money? Help them understand what was happening on the ground and make a change. So off I went into the world of philanthropy only to discover that trillions of dollars are in donor-advised funds and private foundations just waiting to be donated. Meanwhile, those nonprofits and community-led organizations are wasting so much time filling out paperwork and competing over scraps. I&amp;apos;d hear a donor publicly support a cause like homelessness. And then behind closed doors, I&amp;apos;d hear, &amp;quot;They don&amp;apos;t really know what&amp;apos;s good for them. What they really need is ...&amp;quot; Which is code for “donor knows best.” I was confused. How could a donor possibly know what was really needed? Their lifestyle look nothing like the people they wanted to help. The problem wasn&amp;apos;t a lack of money. Again, trillions of dollars are sitting just waiting to be put to work. But even if we unlocked every single one of those dollars, it actually wouldn&amp;apos;t matter because a very small group of people are making all of the decisions about funding. Their priorities, their way. Almost 70 percent of donations are directed by the top one percent of donors. And they choose causes that resonate with their lives, like their university or the arts. And these issues are overfunded. And look, I know that donors have good intentions. I really do. But good intentions are not good enough. Communities are being left behind, and we are running out of time. I wanted to shift the power dynamic from a top-down approach to a community-led model, where nonprofits and donors really work together. So in 2020, I co-founded the Foundation for Black Communities with Liban Abokor, Djaka Blais-Amare and Joseph Smith, to do exactly that. We were inspired by a radically different type of philanthropy, Black philanthropy. It&amp;apos;s the formal and informal giving that happens in Black communities around the world. In some cases, it&amp;apos;s the kind of giving that you don&amp;apos;t get a tax receipt for. And I learned this mostly in my family. We do almost everything together, including box hand. Box hand is an informal savings group, and in my family we have 13 members. So twice a month we all throw a hand, meaning we put 100 dollars into the pot and one person gets the entire thing, 1,300 dollars. The person who gets the full amount rotates, and you&amp;apos;ll get the full thing two times a year. It&amp;apos;s helped my family buy a new fridge, pay school tuition, and you know what, we&amp;apos;ve even put a down payment on a house using this. And sometimes we negotiate. &amp;quot;Oh, you need your hand ahead of me? No problem, I&amp;apos;ll wait.&amp;quot; Of the 13 people, some really need it. It&amp;apos;s their only means of savings. And others would be fine without it. But here, we&amp;apos;re all equal. There is no top or bottom. It&amp;apos;s not about charity or pity or sympathy. The goal of box hand is that everybody levels up. And it’s easier to level up together because we&amp;apos;re accountable to the collective. This practice has existed across the African diaspora since the 1700s. In Guyana, we call it box hand. In Nigeria, its “susu.” In Mali and Senegal it’s “tontines.” In Haiti, it’s called “sol.” And in Jamaica, it’s “partner.” And the cool thing is this exists outside of the African diaspora, too. It looks slightly different from place to place. The Haida nation has potlatches, in Mexico, there&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;tandas&amp;quot; and in Cambodia, there&amp;apos;s &amp;quot;tontine.&amp;quot; And communities turn to each other and use this kind of collective approach when we face exclusion and systemic racism in the financial industry. For example, Black people are rejected business loans and mortgages at twice the rate of the general population. And so when we face that exclusion, we turn to our communities and are creative in our solution-making. And, you know, this has been passed down from generation to generation. My mother taught me this. She gives generously to our communities because they gave generously to her. Now and forever, the collective giving never stops. Black philanthropy is rooted in a concept called Ubuntu. It&amp;apos;s an African philosophy widely understood as humanity towards others. And we have a saying: “I am because you are.” Or &amp;quot;I am because we are.&amp;quot; And that means, what affects you affects me. We&amp;apos;re all interconnected and have a shared responsibility to one another. Ubuntu would be the guiding principle for the Foundation for Black Communities. And in order to do that, we need to make two practical shifts. Who is making funding decisions, and how those decisions are made? So the who is obvious. We&amp;apos;re looking at Black community members, but we&amp;apos;re looking for true, on-the-ground experts. And this is an important distinction. Some people will say to me, &amp;quot;Rebecca, you&amp;apos;re Black. Tell us what&amp;apos;s best for Black communities,&amp;quot; which is actually ridiculous. How could I possibly speak on behalf of all Black people? You can&amp;apos;t, it&amp;apos;s not possible. So to have real insight, we’d look for local experts and let them make the decisions. Because they know their communities, their partners and field the best. And this is what we did in our recent, 500,000-dollar youth wellness granting program. We received 99 eligible applications from Black groups working in everything from diabetes awareness to inner-city farming and after school programming. And just like box hand, we turn to the collective and extended an invitation to be part of our grant review panel. Now, the invitation was intentionally put to anybody connected to the project. It might be a program manager, a participant or a volunteer. And those volunteers became peer reviewers. The peer reviewers read each application, scored them and offered candid feedback. And then we used their rankings to allocate funding. In other words, it was the collective that made the funding decision. Now, you might be thinking, &amp;quot;What&amp;apos;s the big deal about that?&amp;quot; But after years in philanthropy, I can tell you, that&amp;apos;s not how it&amp;apos;s typically done. It&amp;apos;s usually the donor, maybe their relative or a CEO who has the final say. But here, we trusted community to do the work and to make those funding decisions. Luckily, we&amp;apos;re not the first or only to pool funding and trust community to make decisions. We&amp;apos;re part of a growing movement that&amp;apos;s changing the power dynamics in philanthropy. And recently, because of our community-led approach and collective advocacy, the Canadian government awarded the Foundation for Black Communities a historic 200 million dollars. (Cheers and applause) This is amazing. And I&amp;apos;m hopeful that private foundations and donors will follow this powerful example. You know, there are hundreds of community-led collaboratives working in the most pressing issues of our times. For example, there’s Right Relations Collaborative, and Indigenous peoples are making the decisions there. At the Equality Fund, feminists are making the decisions. And at CLIMA Fund, climate activists are making the decisions. When I think back on my time in the front lines, I wonder, if different people were making the funding decisions would those blue slips even have existed? Because the funding was always available. It just wasn&amp;apos;t accessible to the communities who need it most. And this is finally changing with community-led collaborative funds. Even after all of my time in the sector, the highs and lows, I&amp;apos;m optimistic, because the future of philanthropy is happening right now, where community-led collaboratives are the bridge between people who want to do good with their money and the people on the ground with the experience to do it. This is Ubuntu. We are all interconnected, and each of us has a role to play. I am because you are. I am because we are. Thank you. (Applause and cheers)</td>\n",

       "      <td>I became obsessed with the relationship between the brain and the mind after suffering a series of concussions playing football and rugby in college. I felt my mind change for years after. I was studying computers at the time, and it felt as though I had damaged my hardware and that my software was running differently. Over the following years, a close friend suffered a serious neck injury and multiple friends and family members were struggling with crippling mental health issues. All around me, people that I loved dearly were being afflicted by ailments of the nervous system or the mind. I was grappling with all of this while pursuing an MFA in Design and Technology at Parsons when a friend and fellow student showed me an open-source tutorial on how to build a low-cost single-channel EEG system to detect brain activity. After a couple long nights of hacking and tinkering, I saw my brainwaves dancing across the screen for the very first time. And that moment changed my life. In that moment, I felt as though I had the possibility to help myself and the people I loved. And I also realized that I couldn&amp;apos;t do it alone. I needed help. So in 2013, in Brooklyn, with some like-minded friends, I started OpenBCI, an open-source neurotechnology company. In the beginning, our goal was to build an inward-pointing telescope and to share the blueprints with the world so that anybody with a computer could begin peering into their own brain. At first, we were an EEG-only company. We sold brain sensors to measure brain activity. I thought that&amp;apos;s what people wanted. But over time, we discovered people doing very strange things with our technology. Some people were connecting the equipment to the stomach to measure the neurons in the gut and study gut-brain connection and the microbiome. Others were using the tools to build new muscle sensors and controllers for prosthetics and robotics. And some were designing new devices and peripheral add-ons that could be connected to the platform to measure new types of data that I had never heard of before. What we learned from all of this is that the brain by itself is actually quite boring. Turns out brain data alone lacks context. And what we ultimately care about is not the brain, but the mind, consciousness, human cognition. When we have things like EMG sensors to measure muscle activity or ECG sensors to measure heart activity, eye trackers and even environmental sensors to measure the world around us, all of this makes the brain data much more useful. But the organs around our body, our sensory receptors, are actually much easier to collect data from than the brain, and also arguably much more important for determining the things that we actually care about: emotions, intentions and the mind overall. Additionally, we realized that people weren&amp;apos;t just interested in reading from the brain and the body. They were also interested in modulating the mind through various types of sensory stimulation. Things like light, sound, haptics and electricity. It&amp;apos;s one thing to record the mind, it&amp;apos;s another to modulate it. The idea of a combined system that can both read from and write to the brain or body is referred to as a closed-loop system or bidirectional human interface. This concept is truly profound, and it will define the next major revolution in computing technology. When you have products that not just are designed for the average user but are designed to actually adapt to their user, that&amp;apos;s something truly special. When we know what the data of an emotion or a feeling looks like and we know how to make that data go up or down, then using AI, we can build constructive or destructive interference patterns to either amplify or suppress those emotions or feelings. In the very near future, we will have computers that we are resonantly and subconsciously connected to, enabling empathetic computing for the very first time. In 2018, we put these learnings to work and began development of a new tool for cognitive exploration. Named after my friend Gael, who passed from ALS in 2016, we call it Galea. It’s a multimodal bio-sensing headset, and it is absolutely packed with sensors. It can measure the user’s heart, skin, muscles, eyes and brain, and it combines that capability with head-mounted displays or augmented and virtual reality headsets. Additionally, we&amp;apos;re exploring the integration of non-invasive electrical neural stimulation as a feature. The Galea software suite can turn the raw sensor data into meaningful metrics. With some of the sensors, we&amp;apos;re able to provide new forms of real-time interactivity and control. And with all of the sensors, we&amp;apos;re able to make quantifiable inferences about high-level states of mind, things like stress, fatigue, cognitive workload and focus. In 2019, a legendary neurohacker by the name of Christian Bayerlein reached out to me. He was actually one of our very first Kickstarter backers when we got started, early on. Christian was a very smart, intelligent, happy-go-lucky and easygoing guy. And so I worked up the courage to ask him, &amp;quot;Hey, Christian, can we connect you to our sensors?&amp;quot; At which point he said, &amp;quot;I thought you would never ask.&amp;quot; (Laughter) So after 20 minutes, we had him rigged up to a bunch of electrodes, and we provided him with four new inputs to a computer. Little digital buttons, that he could control voluntarily. This essentially doubled his number of inputs to a computer. Years later, after many setbacks due to COVID, we flew to Germany to work with Christian in person to implement the first prototype of what we&amp;apos;re going to be demoing here today. Christian then spent months training with that prototype and sending his data across the Atlantic to us in Brooklyn from Germany and flying a virtual drone in our offices. The first thing that we did was scour Christian&amp;apos;s body for residual motor function. We then connected electrodes to the four muscles that he had the most voluntary control over, and then we turned those muscles into digital buttons. We then applied some smart filtering and signal processing to adapt those buttons into something more like a slider or a digital potentiometer. After that, we turned those four sliders and mapped them to a new virtual joystick. Christian then combined that new joystick with the joystick that he uses with his lip to control his wheelchair, and with the two joysticks combined, Christian finally had control over all the manual controls of a drone. I’m going to stop talking about it, and we’re going to show you. Christian, welcome. (Applause) At this point, I&amp;apos;m going to ask everybody to turn off your Bluetooth and put your phones in airplane mode so that you don&amp;apos;t get hit in the face with a drone. (Laughter) How are you feeling, Christian? Christian Bayerlein: Yeah, let&amp;apos;s do it. Conor Russomanno: Awesome. This is a heads-up display that&amp;apos;s showing all of Christian&amp;apos;s biometric data, as well as some information about the drone. On the left here, we can see Christian&amp;apos;s muscle data. Christian is now going to attempt to fly the drone. How are you feeling, Christian, feeling good? CB: Yes. CR: All right. Rock and roll. Let&amp;apos;s take this up for a joyride. Whenever you&amp;apos;re ready. CB: I&amp;apos;m ready. (Applause and cheers) CR: All right, take her up. And now let&amp;apos;s do something we probably shouldn&amp;apos;t do and fly it over the audience. (Laughter) (Cheers and applause) Alright, actually, let’s do this. I&amp;apos;m going to ask for people to call out some commands in the audience. So how about you? Straight forward. Straight forward. (Laughter) Alright. How about you? Man: Up! (Laughter) CR: Not down. Oh, he&amp;apos;s doing what he wants right now. Amazing. (Cheers and applause) Alright, let’s bring it back. And what I&amp;apos;m going to do right now is take control of the controller so that you guys know that there isn&amp;apos;t someone backstage flying this drone. All right, Christian, you&amp;apos;re alright with that? CB: Yeah. CR: Unplug. Forward. And we&amp;apos;re going to land this guy now. CB: I think I was better than you. (Laughter) (Applause) CR: Amazing. (Applause) Now I&amp;apos;m going to unplug it so it doesn&amp;apos;t turn on on its own. Perfect. Christian has repurposed dormant muscles from around his body for extended and augmented interactivity. We have turned those muscles into a generic controller that in this case we&amp;apos;ve mapped into a drone, but what&amp;apos;s really cool is that joystick can be applied to anything. Another thing that&amp;apos;s really cool is that even in individuals who are not living with motor disabilities, there exist dozens of dormant muscles around the body that we can tap into for augmented and expanded control interactivity. And lastly, all the code related to that virtual joystick, we&amp;apos;re going to open source so that you can implement it and improve upon it. There&amp;apos;s three things that have stood out to me from working on this project and many others over the years. One, we cannot conflate the brain with the mind. In order to understand emotions and tensions and the mind overall, we have to measure data from all over the body, not just the brain. Two, open-source technology access and literacy is one way that we can combat the potential ethical challenges we face in introducing neural technology to society. But that&amp;apos;s not enough. We have to do much, much more than that. It&amp;apos;s very important, imperative, that we set up guardrails and design the future that we want to live in. Three. It&amp;apos;s the courage and resilience of trailblazers like Christian who don&amp;apos;t get bogged down by what they can&amp;apos;t do, but instead strive to prove that the impossible is in fact possible. (Applause) And since none of this would have been possible without you, Christian, the stage is yours. CB: Yeah, hi, everybody. Audience: Hi. CB: I&amp;apos;m excited to be here today. I was born with a genetic condition that affects my mobility and requires me to have assistance. Despite my disability, I&amp;apos;m a very happy and fulfilled person. What truly holds me back are not my physical limitations. It&amp;apos;s rather the barriers in the environment. I&amp;apos;m a tech nerd and political activist. I believe that technology can empower disabled people. It can help create a better, more inclusive and accessible world for everyone. This demonstration is a perfect example. We saw what&amp;apos;s possible when cutting edge technology is combined with human curiosity and creativity. So let&amp;apos;s build tools that empower people, applications that break down barriers and systems that unlock a world of possibilities. I think that&amp;apos;s an idea worth spreading. Thank you.

Well, when I was a little girl, whenever I was asked the question, my answer was pretty much always the same: &amp;quot;When I grow up, I want to become a man.&amp;quot; To my logic, that was the only way I could live a life free from the suffocating restrictions that women in my birth country of Iran were forced to endure. I&amp;apos;m not quite sure where this line of thinking started from, but a particularly hot summer&amp;apos;s afternoon comes to mind. I was nine years old and along with my family, as we did on every summer holiday, we had traveled to the north of Iran to a little seaside village called Chamkhaleh. For as long as I remember, some of my best childhood memories are of me swimming in the Caspian Sea, paddling in its waves and making sandcastles on its gorgeous beaches. All of those lovely memories, though, were about to be rewritten. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, when a girl turns nine years old, she has legally entered womanhood. And that means having to follow a series of restrictive rules written by men. The most symbolic of which is probably the mandatory wearing of the hijab. That year, my mom had to sit me down and sorrowfully explain that I was now too old to get into the water wearing a swimsuit. Now that I was nine years old, it was illegal. And if I wanted to get into the water like all the other women, I had to go in fully covered from head to toe. I had to go in wearing a pair of trousers, a long-sleeved top and a loose covering called the manto to cover it all. And of course, the headscarf. I still remember the lump in my throat as I set foot in the water. I could no longer feel the fresh coolness of the Caspian Sea against my skin. Instead, my now-wet layers felt itchy and weird. I can still remember feeling the watchful eyes of the morality police, the so-called morality police, making sure that me and the other girls were not showing too much hair or too much skin to, God forbid, arouse the men. It was as if my former freedoms were washing away with every tide and flow of the water. Next, I&amp;apos;m deep in the water. I was a good swimmer, but my layers were so heavy and restrictive. I tried to gasp for air, but my headscarf kept blocking my face. The tides were pulling me further and further out. I could see my mom and dad on the beach, I tried to call for help, but they couldn&amp;apos;t hear me. Perhaps my voice was drowned out by the roaring engines of the bikes that the morality police were patrolling the beaches. The tides continued, pulling me further and further out and hopelessness started creeping in. Next, I wake up on the beach, cold, wet, shivering. It turns out my father had just spotted my struggles in time and had rushed in to get me. That was the last time I ever set foot in my beloved Caspian Sea. Growing up in the Islamic Republic of Iran, every day it felt as though I was going through the same experience but in different ways. And looking at the women in my life, they seemed to be going through the same thing too, in different ways. And the older I grew, the further out the tides of oppression, injustice, inequality felt like they were pulling me in. Wherever I turned, shame, fear and especially hopelessness were ever-present. Women in Iran are second-class citizens. They have almost no access when it comes to some of the most basic rights like divorce, custody of children and even travel. They have no legal protection against sexual harassment and domestic violence. They are not allowed to sing in public or have sex outside of marriage, and they&amp;apos;re only allowed to show their face and hand in public. In the 20 years or so since I almost drowned, nothing has changed. Iranian women have been adrift in a vast sea of oppression. Their only way out, for those who could, is to leave themselves at the mercy of people smugglers, set out on dangerous journeys in hope of finding safety in a land far away. That&amp;apos;s what happened to me. Age 12, along with my mom and my baby sister, we escaped Iran. And after years of living in refugee camps across Europe, sleeping rough and being at the mercy of some very, very dodgy people smugglers, we finally found safe haven here, in the UK. For my friends and family who stayed behind, there was little hope for change. And so when in September last year, 22-year-old Mahsa Jina Amini stepped out of the metro onto the bustling streets of Tehran, there was little reason to expect a change to the status quo. The same way that it&amp;apos;s happened to my own mother and many other women I know, Mahsa was arrested by the so-called morality police because, in their opinion, she was showing more hair than they deemed acceptable. Three days later, Mahsa died in police custody. This time, though, something changed. Thanks to the power of social media and the brave journalists working hard on the ground, the news of Mahsa&amp;apos;s killing wasn&amp;apos;t drowned out in the regime&amp;apos;s relentless propaganda. In the same way that the unjust killing of George Floyd ignited the Black Lives Matter movement, the unjust killing of Mahsa Amini ignited the biggest anti-regime protests across Iran since the formation of the Islamic Republic in 1979. For the first time in decades, women in Iran are finally daring to defy the strict morality laws. In a fight for equality and dignity, they are taking off their headscarves, burning them in bonfires, and some are cutting off their hair. They&amp;apos;re chanting &amp;quot;Zan. Zendegi. Azadi.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Woman, Life, Freedom.&amp;quot; Furious crowds are calling for democracy, for freedom of speech, for freedom of expression, whilst many others are calling for the fall of the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Khamenei is Iran&amp;apos;s spiritual leader and has the final say over all government matters. For the first time in a very, very long time, there seems to be hope in the air. Hope that perhaps change in Iran is possible. And that&amp;apos;s exactly why the crackdown has been so brutal and deadly. These are the faces of the protesters who fought for freedom but will not live to see it. Since the protest began nearly five months ago, around 500 people have been killed. Nearly 80 of those children. Around 18,000 protesters have been arrested. And there are reports of psychological, physical and sexual torture in prisons. There has been a series of hasty trials, forced confessions and public executions of the protesters. The authoritarian regime of Iran is clearly desperate to kill any and all hope because they know that for as long as we remain hopeless, we&amp;apos;ll resign to their oppression and injustice. But as history has shown over and over again, the light of hope emerges from the depth of darkness. Hope is angry. It&amp;apos;s defiant. Hope is dangerous. Hope is standing its ground on the streets of Iran, chanting &amp;quot;Woman, Life, Freedom.&amp;quot; Hope is in political prisons, biding its time, sustaining those in shackles. Hope has now spread to the four corners of my birth country. As a journalist, I can&amp;apos;t travel to Iran. But as my sisters in Tehran, Mashhad, Shiraz, Baluchistan, Kurdistan, shomal, jonoob, shargh, gharb, all over Iran have done, I, too, I&amp;apos;m going to cut my hair to show my solidarity with the movement. (Cheers and applause) (Cheers and applause continues) Thank you. (Applause continues) (Applause ends) Thank you. Audience: Freedom for women! (Cheers) SZ: This hair, for too long, has been intertwined with religion and politics. But I say with my sisters in Iran: no more. And I say with them: Women, to reclaim our rights. (Applause and cheers) Life, for the lives unjustly taken. (Applause) Freedom, for the liberation of my people. (Applause) I stand here with my hair in my hand, in hope of a future where no little girl has to wish she were a man because she&amp;apos;s terrified that she might drown every day. (Applause) Yes, the crackdown is brutal. And yes, there might not be a solution inside yet. But the only thing that can help create and sustain one is hope. Sorry. (Cheers and applause) The only thing that can help create and sustain one is hope. And every single one of us can take a step and play our part. I&amp;apos;m standing here speaking to you now. Many non-Iranians and Iranians outside of Iran have been signing petitions, going to protest, putting pressure on their governments so that in turn, they put pressure on the Iranian regime and government. For the past few months, I&amp;apos;ve been speaking to protesters inside of Iran, and they tell me how much it matters to them that we on the outside stay informed and engaged. So let&amp;apos;s try our best to make certain that those of us on the shore let those at sea know that we see them, that we hear their cries. Thank you for taking a step towards a future where freedom is not just a dream, but a reality. Not just for women, but for everyone. And not just in Iran, but everywhere. Thank you.

       "0  Hello, I am Machine Dazzle, and I am an emotionally-driven, instinct-based conceptual artist, designer and musician. Today I&apos;m going to talk about the power of transformation through the sacred ritual of costume. With the help of my friend Matty Crosland. Matty? Oh, hey, girl. (Laughs) Matty is going to hand out a few seeds of possibility while I continue. Growing up in Middle America, I wasn&apos;t allowed to be who I was. I was discouraged from a career in the arts. When we went to the toy store, my two brothers would run to the black and blue aisle and I would run to the pink aisle. There was a lot of shame surrounding my preference for &quot;girls&apos;&quot; toys. I shoplifted my first Barbie. Desperate people do desperate things. But what was really happening during that time is I was building up a massive reserve of ideas, unrealized desires and dreams. And when I bought that one-way ticket to New York, which is the first decision I ever truly made for myself, I brought with me that reserve of unrealized dreams, desires and ideas. And that&apos;s when I really started to take risks. And I learned about the power of transformation, starting with becoming my true self. In 2019, I was commissioned by Guggenheim Works and Process to do a show. I knew immediately that I wanted to make a show about my mother, Deborah. Here she is, printed on my dress. It was the &apos;60s, the bouffant, the cat-eye frames. Maybe some of you remember. Sadly, I lost my mother in 1996 to cancer. So in her honor, I created a rock and roll cabaret. It features songs that I wrote and sang about her, my relationship with her and my self-actualization. It is called &quot;Treasure,&quot; and you can listen to it on your favorite streaming service. In fact, I just released the first dance track from it. It&apos;s called &quot;Understand,&quot; and if you like to wiggle your peach, then you should look it up. (Laughter) My opening outfit, I created this big &apos;60s bouffant. It is made out of about 2,500 metallic pipe cleaners. Why pipe cleaners? Because wigs are common. And I like to challenge existing systems and take risks. And it is actually quite heavy. Transformation takes commitment. Did I mention that my work is maximal? We are complex beings. We exist in many layers. Speaking of layers, then I added this swing coat. It&apos;s made out of an old American flag camouflaged in paint, dye and adorned with flowers. Flowers that I found in the dumpster at the cemetery where my mother&apos;s ashes are buried. Yes, people take fake flowers off of the graves, throw them into the dumpster to put new fake flowers on the graves. I thought it was appropriate. And so there it is, a source of protection. On stage, I became not my mother, that wasn&apos;t the point. I became a higher version of myself. Not man, not woman. Something other. In this show, I&apos;m hoping to realize all of my dreams and not just mine, but all of my mother&apos;s, too, because she had them. More is more. One of my -- yes, I wish you could all have them, but you know how it is. (Laughter) Pom pom on head, look at that. One of my most maximal projects to date is with my favorite collaborator, Taylor Mac. Together with hundreds of others, we created a 24-hour show. It is called &quot;24 Decades: A History of Popular Music.&quot; It premiered in Brooklyn at St. Ann’s Warehouse in 2016. It&apos;s a 24-hour show. It starts in 1776 and goes to the present day. Every hour of the show is dedicated to a different decade in American history. For every decade, I created a costume that is conceptually adjacent, not historically accurate. Why? Because traditional historical costume already exists, conceptually and otherwise. And I like to break traditions and invent new ones. And when you break an egg, there are countless ways to turn it into something delicious. So it’s high noon in Brooklyn at St. Ann’s Warehouse. It&apos;s the top of the show in 1776, right after we freed ourselves from the British in the United States. And inspiration came when I was walking in Brooklyn, where I live. I was passing this laundromat. What were they doing? They were taking down these old, plastic, grand-opening flags. What were they doing? They were putting up new plastic, grand-opening flags. Well, I snatched them out of the garbage because, you know, and I noticed how weather-worn and brittle and fragile they were. And I got to thinking about the end of the American Revolution and how tattered and torn and broken everything must have been. And then it hit me. This costume wants to tell a story. An illegitimate child of colonialism ran away from home to New Orleans and opened the laundromat called Lou Washery, and they are celebrating the Grand Overture as the official, unofficial cheerleader of the original 13 colonies. This is maximalism. Not only is it layer upon layer aesthetically, it&apos;s idea on top of idea conceptually. It becomes its own story, almost that you can almost read like a book. Well, if history has taught us anything, it&apos;s that things change. Here we are an hour later in the show, and it&apos;s time for a costume change. An apple pie as a headdress. The care and the craft and the smell of home. And I put two pipes on Taylor&apos;s back, upholstered in a colonial fabric, steam was coming out of them at the top of that decade. But you know how it is. And they represent the invention of the steam engine, which gave way to westward expansion, for better or for worse. And then I thought, well, what else was happening? Well, George Washington was president at the time, and I was always kind of into his little cherry tree story of virtue. You know, &quot;I cannot tell a lie, I chopped down that cherry tree.&quot; And it was the French Revolution across the pond and the guillotine was like, full on. So I was like, &quot;Well, why don&apos;t I combine them together?&quot; And, oh, you know, severed heads in cherry tree drag as garment. What I&apos;m getting at is, the costume can be so much more than the costume. It can be the props, it can be the set, it can tell its own stories, it can even be its own character. It can be all of it at the same time. This kind of maximalism leaves an audience completely satisfied, yet wanting more at the same time. More is more. Well, wouldn’t you know, now it’s 7pm at night, and it&apos;s time for the Civil War. I took two distinct inventions from this time to help tell this story. I read somewhere once that the American hot dog evolved out of German immigrants selling their bratwurst and rolls on the streets during the 1860s. Well, I like that. And then this distinctive barbed wire, you know, barbed wire, a symbol of separation, security, insecurity. Well, I wanted to combine the two together. In this way of making things, I bring order to disorder. By turning barbed wire into hot dogs, what I&apos;m trying to do, hopefully, is eat through what is separating us, in this case, slavery. When you believe in something that is marginalized and goes against the mainstream of society, it is so important that you do it big, bold, brave and unapologetically, truly. OK, well, here we are after the war again. It’s time for Reconstruction. And, you know, how about the invention of the typewriter? I love the way this piece wiggles as Taylor clicks across the stage. And then the introduction of dynamite and toilet paper on rolls, how domestic! Well, I took those empty toilet paper rolls, and I painted them to look like sticks of dynamite and boom -- headdress, hello. You know, why not? Well, here we are. Now, we&apos;ve been performing all night. We&apos;re tired. It’s 10am. It&apos;s the 1980s. Just in time for the AIDS pandemic. Taylor wears two white, high-heeled shoes sprinkled with little green pom poms. They look like clown shoes, but they represent the white blood cells being attacked by HIV. This collaboration, this &quot;24-Decade History of Popular Music,&quot; took maximalism and &quot;more is more&quot; to a whole new level. I have to say, through the music, the storytelling and the transformative nature of the costumes, we changed the course of queer history. And if nothing else, it sure is fun to pull an all-nighter with 24 costume changes. Well, here we are. This is an image of me on the streets of New York City at the Easter Bonnet Parade several years ago. I am a fan of taking my art to the streets. But I have to tell you, it takes a little bit of courage to dress like this in public, particularly these days. Just about every part of my creative ethos is under attack in the United States right now. On first glance, you might see an over-the-top outfit on a Sunday, in black and white and pink. But upon closer inspection, you&apos;ll see the details, the skull peeking out, the skeletal hand creeping out of the innocent plush animals on my head. I once had my Easter bonnet ripped right off of my head in front of St. Patrick&apos;s Cathedral. Not this one. I don&apos;t think they would dare. Sometimes, I think that life is about overcoming all of your greatest fears. Life itself is how you go about that. I go all the way. I do the work. There is no happiness that I know unless I am risking something. The only true happiness that I know comes from this sense of accomplishment, by taking the risk. Well, here I am again on the streets of New York, this time for the Reclaim Pride March back in 2019 again. A good friend gave me really good advice once. &quot;Machine, it&apos;s never too early to be pre-revolutionary, and it&apos;s never too late to be post-apocalyptic chic.&quot; (Laughter) Sometimes this course of action, this transformation, is the most honest action that you can take. You owe yourself honesty. I consider it a prayer. Today, after all, is a placeholder for what&apos;s coming tomorrow. By becoming other, you avoid labels. You can change someone&apos;s life just by walking across the room because you are changing what is possible in their minds. Be more. You will get more out of life. And not just for you, for everyone around you. I&apos;m telling you, that is the Gospel truth. Another thing I wanted to say, this collective land of make-believe that we are in right now, this is very fertile, very creative space where anything is possible. Matty, let&apos;s bring it home. (Music: &quot;Miss Object of Desire&quot; by Machine Dazzle) Mother, I want to be Miss Object of Desire A walking dream, a Phoenix lips of fire Strange reflection in the perfumed air Changing faces till she settles where a memory vibrates Liberation (Applause) (Music continues) Broken glass and my dress is torn Screaming in silence Thank you.

       "2                                                                                                                                                                       Can you paint with all the colors of the wind? I love this song from the first time I heard it. I was 14, growing up in public housing in western Sydney. So maybe a little too old for this Disney classic from &quot;Pocahontas.&quot; But it spoke to me. I saw something of myself in it. At this stage, I think I knew I was queer. I mean, come on, I was rocking out to Disney. (Laughter) And look at those glasses. (Laughter) Seriously, what a queer kid. (Laughter) But I was also from a Pacific Indigenous heritage with conservative views and values. I didn&apos;t feel like I could fit into any of the boxes that were being presented to me. Straight, gay, Fijian, Australian. I couldn&apos;t pick just one color to paint with. Prior to colonization, sexuality amongst many of our Pacific islands across the region was fluid. Men would have sex with men without the stigma or shame afforded it today. Sexual intimacy was a way of being able to connect socially and relationally. Sex wasn&apos;t just for procreation. Or in marriage. It wasn&apos;t exclusively monogamous. Just because you had sex with a man didn&apos;t define your sexuality. It didn&apos;t make you an outcast. But as Europeans started to colonize the Pacific region, they brought Christian missionaries with them. They told us to cover up our beautiful bodies. We were taught shame. We were told to stop practicing Pacifica cultures and values that were seen as provocative. To a Western and white perspective, our non-binary sexuality was judged as tribal, outdated, sinful and impossible to practice alongside a Christian faith. Still today, those who are Indigenous to the Pacific are negatively impacted by whiteness. That “white is right, West is best.” I was brought up to espouse strong Christian beliefs, views and values which would shape my burgeoning identity as an adult. From these staunch conservative views, I was taught to fear the queer. Those people that were seen as unusual and fruity. And in essence, I grew to despise a part of myself. I sought to separate my queerness from my identity. I could never see myself as part of that world. Growing up, biracial and bisexual constantly challenged the way I saw the world around me. I was unsure about my thinking, feelings and behaviors around liking males and females. I was unsure about my thinking, feelings and behaviors when it came to whether I needed to be a white Australian or a Fijian person. And whether this needed to be framed within a binary to choose one over the other. In this way, I don&apos;t think that my story is unique. There&apos;s plenty of people in the queer world that have escaped conservative upbringings, religions and cultures. But this is only part of my story. Another common story in the queer community is the coming-out story. When did you tell your parents? How did they react? How it liberated you or ultimately separated you from your family. But this didn&apos;t feel like an option for me either. I believe that embedded in these particular stories, these tropes, is a part of dominant queer culture that made it very hard for me to access the queer world. For example, when I started to go to gay clubs, I would be lining up at the front of the club and often I would get door staff come up to me and go, &quot;Sorry, you do know this is a gay club, right?&quot; From these lived experiences, I feel that there is a whiteness that pervades queer culture. And I didn&apos;t want to give up my identity and my appearance as a Pacific indigenous person to be queer. Pacifica cultures really, really value and esteem the collective above the individual. For Pacifica people, our families are inextricably connected to our own sense of self-agency, self-determination, self-esteem, self-love and self-worth. Our own individual identities are meshed and intertwined with our family&apos;s reputation and standing in the community. Our mind, body and souls are inextricably connected to the broader community, to our families, to ourselves and to others. I didn&apos;t want to come out to potentially ostracize myself, to make a point to separate myself from my Pacific and faith communities. I couldn&apos;t then see my authentic self in any of these spaces. And a quick shout out to my son on the left-hand side. Round of applause for my son. (Laughs) (Applause) He said to me this morning, &quot;Daddy, make sure you mention me.&quot; So I was like, &quot;OK, son. Alright.&quot; So there you go for the recording, son. And the rest are my other family, that&apos;s up there as well. Across queer cultures and the broader community, we have learned to embrace our gender and sexual differences. We encourage individuals to be allies for each other and to support safe spaces for those that are seen to not fit in. We empower and really encourage individuals to really develop and express their self-agency, their self-determination, their self love, their self-worth. We boldly go into spaces striving to bring others with us to ensure that we can create inclusive societies for everyone. However, the dominant Western view in queer cultures is still based on the individual. Me, myself and I. And my individual pursuits towards happiness. As a queer Indigenous Pacific person, I feel that there are parts of queer culture that is white, feels very white. We may fail to see the importance of bringing our families and our cultural communities along our journey as queer people. It&apos;s either the queer way or the highway. It&apos;s one or the other. Young or old. Rich or poor. Smart or stupid. Masculine or feminine. Fit or fat. These binaries create a sense of us and them, those people. A binary approach and position that we generally in Western white societies use to determine the norm. We create, conflate, perpetuate binaries that create divisions in our society. Saints or sinner, straight or gay. I see it like this. Binaries are a very white and Western way of thinking, feeling and behaving. As individuals today, we live within these binaries and create identities that then create these labels. We use these labels to then define and confine people and places. We are one or the other. But what we fail to see is that our identities are more than a set of binaries. Our own identities are comprised of intersecting identifiers that contributes to who you are, including our age, class, color, education, gender, size, spirituality, sexuality, and so, so much more. We need to decolonize queerness, to live beyond “white is right, West is best.” Because if we don&apos;t, we&apos;re going to continue to create silos and divisions in our societies that don&apos;t create inclusive and safe spaces for everyone. For Indigenous queer people, they shape our connection to community and culture, our families. If we don&apos;t include that within our understanding of who we are, even as queer people, then we&apos;re not able to be, again, our true and authentic selves. We&apos;re not able to then be our fabulous selves as part of the queer community. And it&apos;s really, really interesting because I believe that we can learn so much from pre-colonial cultures like those that were practiced in the Pacific, that provide a different way of looking at a society. A queer way that pre-dates all the privileges that go into binary ways of thinking, feeling and behaving. Across many of our Pacifica languages we have a lot of key concepts that help solidify and support a shared understanding of the collective. For example, in Fijian, &quot;solesolevaki&quot; is all about reciprocal living, where my wellbeing is your wellbeing. I will actively seek to ensure that your well-being and every part of your life is catered for, knowing that you will do the same for me. We strive to enact “veiqaravi,” as tatted here on my hand, to serve others. We strive to also embed and embold and empower people to practice &quot;veirokovi,&quot; respect for self and others where we are relationally driven, where that is so important to our spaces and places. My sense of ability to actually put this into practice, my ability to actually understand these Indigenous perspectives has greatly helped shape and reconcile my queer identity today. But what&apos;s really interesting is that it&apos;s not just queer communities that need to decolonize itself. It&apos;s all of us as a broader society that needs to be part of a shared conversation to decolonize, deconstruct and disrupt binary ways of thinking, feeling and behaving. So how can we practically do that? Practice cultural humility, where you are constantly learning and embracing differences, where you get over yourselves and strive to learn about other people&apos;s differences and how that can be meaningfully included in the way in which you create safe spaces for everyone. I also believe it&apos;s possible to bring Indigenous perspectives into Western and white workplaces. For example, I’ve introduced the concept of “talanoa” in all of my work meetings. Talanoa is all about being able to create a safe space where everyone is able to contribute to a collective, collegial and collaborative conversation. Where people are able to bring their authentic selves into these spaces. Literally, I will chair meetings where I have no firm set agenda items and I literally would just hold space for participants just to bring themselves. So you can tell I&apos;m a social worker, right? (Laughter) Safe space, safe space, safe space. It&apos;s OK, it&apos;s OK. But it&apos;s through these safe spaces that people can bring their multiple, intersecting identifiers, including their age, their class, color, education, gender, size, spirituality, sexuality and so, so much more. I invite queer communities to come talanoa with Pacific Indigenous Communities to create robust and resilient queer cultures. I have been able to greatly reconcile my queer and Pacifica identities, which has now really been embraced to help shape how I see the world around me today. And it&apos;s through these shared perspectives and approaches that we can truly embrace cultural diversity and its differences. And to know that people can live beyond those binaries and those labels we continue to perpetuate and perpetrate against others. It is a commitment from queer communities to decolonize queerness. It&apos;s a commitment from me, from you and all of us to decolonize Western and white societies and to live beyond the binary way of thinking, feeling and behaving. I genuinely believe that it&apos;s through this common goal that we can truly learn how to paint with all the colors of the wind. “Vinaka vakalevu” and thank you.  \n",
       "3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I spent my whole career in the nonprofit sector. Street outreach, program management, fundraising, grant making, public policy, you name it, I&apos;ve done it. I&apos;ve seen a lot. And I&apos;m a really positive person, so it&apos;s actually difficult to say this. But the way we do philanthropy right now, the way we&apos;ve done it for decades, is broken. And here&apos;s how I found out. In my early 20s, I was a frontline social worker in New York City, working with people living with HIV. Many of them had multiple chronic illnesses, and they were underhoused. So I&apos;d spend my days, and even some nights, with them, running around the city to doctor&apos;s appointments and housing agencies. The day-to-day work was hard. But the hardest part was we never had had enough funding to do the work. On Friday mornings, I&apos;d go into the office to write up my case notes for the week and I&apos;d speed past front reception, not looking at the mailboxes full of blue slips. Each blue letter marked another colleague let go because of our funding crisis. Within one month, I’d lost half my team, and my caseload ballooned from 30 to over 100. And this is the reality for so many nonprofits. They&apos;re at the mercy of their funders. And when we look at those funders, they decide who and what gets funded. And it&apos;s almost always a mystery how they make those decisions. Nonprofits spend so much time fundraising, filling out pages and pages and pages of paperwork. And they&apos;re filling out so much paperwork that they hardly have any time to actually support communities, which is literally the thing that they&apos;re funded to do. After years of doing amazing work, improving every single metric, we&apos;d hear things like, &quot;I&apos;m sorry, our major donor has switched direction. They’re no longer working and investing in HIV and AIDS.” Or, “I’m sorry, we issue grants for three years max.&quot; This would never happen in the private sector. You do an amazing job for three years and then get fired? It makes no sense. So I decided to switch sides. Instead of being on the side that&apos;s asking for money, what if I went to the side that was giving money? Help them understand what was happening on the ground and make a change. So off I went into the world of philanthropy only to discover that trillions of dollars are in donor-advised funds and private foundations just waiting to be donated. Meanwhile, those nonprofits and community-led organizations are wasting so much time filling out paperwork and competing over scraps. I&apos;d hear a donor publicly support a cause like homelessness. And then behind closed doors, I&apos;d hear, &quot;They don&apos;t really know what&apos;s good for them. What they really need is ...&quot; Which is code for “donor knows best.” I was confused. How could a donor possibly know what was really needed? Their lifestyle look nothing like the people they wanted to help. The problem wasn&apos;t a lack of money. Again, trillions of dollars are sitting just waiting to be put to work. But even if we unlocked every single one of those dollars, it actually wouldn&apos;t matter because a very small group of people are making all of the decisions about funding. Their priorities, their way. Almost 70 percent of donations are directed by the top one percent of donors. And they choose causes that resonate with their lives, like their university or the arts. And these issues are overfunded. And look, I know that donors have good intentions. I really do. But good intentions are not good enough. Communities are being left behind, and we are running out of time. I wanted to shift the power dynamic from a top-down approach to a community-led model, where nonprofits and donors really work together. So in 2020, I co-founded the Foundation for Black Communities with Liban Abokor, Djaka Blais-Amare and Joseph Smith, to do exactly that. We were inspired by a radically different type of philanthropy, Black philanthropy. It&apos;s the formal and informal giving that happens in Black communities around the world. In some cases, it&apos;s the kind of giving that you don&apos;t get a tax receipt for. And I learned this mostly in my family. We do almost everything together, including box hand. Box hand is an informal savings group, and in my family we have 13 members. So twice a month we all throw a hand, meaning we put 100 dollars into the pot and one person gets the entire thing, 1,300 dollars. The person who gets the full amount rotates, and you&apos;ll get the full thing two times a year. It&apos;s helped my family buy a new fridge, pay school tuition, and you know what, we&apos;ve even put a down payment on a house using this. And sometimes we negotiate. &quot;Oh, you need your hand ahead of me? No problem, I&apos;ll wait.&quot; Of the 13 people, some really need it. It&apos;s their only means of savings. And others would be fine without it. But here, we&apos;re all equal. There is no top or bottom. It&apos;s not about charity or pity or sympathy. The goal of box hand is that everybody levels up. And it’s easier to level up together because we&apos;re accountable to the collective. This practice has existed across the African diaspora since the 1700s. In Guyana, we call it box hand. In Nigeria, its “susu.” In Mali and Senegal it’s “tontines.” In Haiti, it’s called “sol.” And in Jamaica, it’s “partner.” And the cool thing is this exists outside of the African diaspora, too. It looks slightly different from place to place. The Haida nation has potlatches, in Mexico, there&apos;s &quot;tandas&quot; and in Cambodia, there&apos;s &quot;tontine.&quot; And communities turn to each other and use this kind of collective approach when we face exclusion and systemic racism in the financial industry. For example, Black people are rejected business loans and mortgages at twice the rate of the general population. And so when we face that exclusion, we turn to our communities and are creative in our solution-making. And, you know, this has been passed down from generation to generation. My mother taught me this. She gives generously to our communities because they gave generously to her. Now and forever, the collective giving never stops. Black philanthropy is rooted in a concept called Ubuntu. It&apos;s an African philosophy widely understood as humanity towards others. And we have a saying: “I am because you are.” Or &quot;I am because we are.&quot; And that means, what affects you affects me. We&apos;re all interconnected and have a shared responsibility to one another. Ubuntu would be the guiding principle for the Foundation for Black Communities. And in order to do that, we need to make two practical shifts. Who is making funding decisions, and how those decisions are made? So the who is obvious. We&apos;re looking at Black community members, but we&apos;re looking for true, on-the-ground experts. And this is an important distinction. Some people will say to me, &quot;Rebecca, you&apos;re Black. Tell us what&apos;s best for Black communities,&quot; which is actually ridiculous. How could I possibly speak on behalf of all Black people? You can&apos;t, it&apos;s not possible. So to have real insight, we’d look for local experts and let them make the decisions. Because they know their communities, their partners and field the best. And this is what we did in our recent, 500,000-dollar youth wellness granting program. We received 99 eligible applications from Black groups working in everything from diabetes awareness to inner-city farming and after school programming. And just like box hand, we turn to the collective and extended an invitation to be part of our grant review panel. Now, the invitation was intentionally put to anybody connected to the project. It might be a program manager, a participant or a volunteer. And those volunteers became peer reviewers. The peer reviewers read each application, scored them and offered candid feedback. And then we used their rankings to allocate funding. In other words, it was the collective that made the funding decision. Now, you might be thinking, &quot;What&apos;s the big deal about that?&quot; But after years in philanthropy, I can tell you, that&apos;s not how it&apos;s typically done. It&apos;s usually the donor, maybe their relative or a CEO who has the final say. But here, we trusted community to do the work and to make those funding decisions. Luckily, we&apos;re not the first or only to pool funding and trust community to make decisions. We&apos;re part of a growing movement that&apos;s changing the power dynamics in philanthropy. And recently, because of our community-led approach and collective advocacy, the Canadian government awarded the Foundation for Black Communities a historic 200 million dollars. (Cheers and applause) This is amazing. And I&apos;m hopeful that private foundations and donors will follow this powerful example. You know, there are hundreds of community-led collaboratives working in the most pressing issues of our times. For example, there’s Right Relations Collaborative, and Indigenous peoples are making the decisions there. At the Equality Fund, feminists are making the decisions. And at CLIMA Fund, climate activists are making the decisions. When I think back on my time in the front lines, I wonder, if different people were making the funding decisions would those blue slips even have existed? Because the funding was always available. It just wasn&apos;t accessible to the communities who need it most. And this is finally changing with community-led collaborative funds. Even after all of my time in the sector, the highs and lows, I&apos;m optimistic, because the future of philanthropy is happening right now, where community-led collaboratives are the bridge between people who want to do good with their money and the people on the ground with the experience to do it. This is Ubuntu. We are all interconnected, and each of us has a role to play. I am because you are. I am because we are. Thank you. (Applause and cheers)  \n",
       "5                               I became obsessed with the relationship between the brain and the mind after suffering a series of concussions playing football and rugby in college. I felt my mind change for years after. I was studying computers at the time, and it felt as though I had damaged my hardware and that my software was running differently. Over the following years, a close friend suffered a serious neck injury and multiple friends and family members were struggling with crippling mental health issues. All around me, people that I loved dearly were being afflicted by ailments of the nervous system or the mind. I was grappling with all of this while pursuing an MFA in Design and Technology at Parsons when a friend and fellow student showed me an open-source tutorial on how to build a low-cost single-channel EEG system to detect brain activity. After a couple long nights of hacking and tinkering, I saw my brainwaves dancing across the screen for the very first time. And that moment changed my life. In that moment, I felt as though I had the possibility to help myself and the people I loved. And I also realized that I couldn&apos;t do it alone. I needed help. So in 2013, in Brooklyn, with some like-minded friends, I started OpenBCI, an open-source neurotechnology company. In the beginning, our goal was to build an inward-pointing telescope and to share the blueprints with the world so that anybody with a computer could begin peering into their own brain. At first, we were an EEG-only company. We sold brain sensors to measure brain activity. I thought that&apos;s what people wanted. But over time, we discovered people doing very strange things with our technology. Some people were connecting the equipment to the stomach to measure the neurons in the gut and study gut-brain connection and the microbiome. Others were using the tools to build new muscle sensors and controllers for prosthetics and robotics. And some were designing new devices and peripheral add-ons that could be connected to the platform to measure new types of data that I had never heard of before. What we learned from all of this is that the brain by itself is actually quite boring. Turns out brain data alone lacks context. And what we ultimately care about is not the brain, but the mind, consciousness, human cognition. When we have things like EMG sensors to measure muscle activity or ECG sensors to measure heart activity, eye trackers and even environmental sensors to measure the world around us, all of this makes the brain data much more useful. But the organs around our body, our sensory receptors, are actually much easier to collect data from than the brain, and also arguably much more important for determining the things that we actually care about: emotions, intentions and the mind overall. Additionally, we realized that people weren&apos;t just interested in reading from the brain and the body. They were also interested in modulating the mind through various types of sensory stimulation. Things like light, sound, haptics and electricity. It&apos;s one thing to record the mind, it&apos;s another to modulate it. The idea of a combined system that can both read from and write to the brain or body is referred to as a closed-loop system or bidirectional human interface. This concept is truly profound, and it will define the next major revolution in computing technology. When you have products that not just are designed for the average user but are designed to actually adapt to their user, that&apos;s something truly special. When we know what the data of an emotion or a feeling looks like and we know how to make that data go up or down, then using AI, we can build constructive or destructive interference patterns to either amplify or suppress those emotions or feelings. In the very near future, we will have computers that we are resonantly and subconsciously connected to, enabling empathetic computing for the very first time. In 2018, we put these learnings to work and began development of a new tool for cognitive exploration. Named after my friend Gael, who passed from ALS in 2016, we call it Galea. It’s a multimodal bio-sensing headset, and it is absolutely packed with sensors. It can measure the user’s heart, skin, muscles, eyes and brain, and it combines that capability with head-mounted displays or augmented and virtual reality headsets. Additionally, we&apos;re exploring the integration of non-invasive electrical neural stimulation as a feature. The Galea software suite can turn the raw sensor data into meaningful metrics. With some of the sensors, we&apos;re able to provide new forms of real-time interactivity and control. And with all of the sensors, we&apos;re able to make quantifiable inferences about high-level states of mind, things like stress, fatigue, cognitive workload and focus. In 2019, a legendary neurohacker by the name of Christian Bayerlein reached out to me. He was actually one of our very first Kickstarter backers when we got started, early on. Christian was a very smart, intelligent, happy-go-lucky and easygoing guy. And so I worked up the courage to ask him, &quot;Hey, Christian, can we connect you to our sensors?&quot; At which point he said, &quot;I thought you would never ask.&quot; (Laughter) So after 20 minutes, we had him rigged up to a bunch of electrodes, and we provided him with four new inputs to a computer. Little digital buttons, that he could control voluntarily. This essentially doubled his number of inputs to a computer. Years later, after many setbacks due to COVID, we flew to Germany to work with Christian in person to implement the first prototype of what we&apos;re going to be demoing here today. Christian then spent months training with that prototype and sending his data across the Atlantic to us in Brooklyn from Germany and flying a virtual drone in our offices. The first thing that we did was scour Christian&apos;s body for residual motor function. We then connected electrodes to the four muscles that he had the most voluntary control over, and then we turned those muscles into digital buttons. We then applied some smart filtering and signal processing to adapt those buttons into something more like a slider or a digital potentiometer. After that, we turned those four sliders and mapped them to a new virtual joystick. Christian then combined that new joystick with the joystick that he uses with his lip to control his wheelchair, and with the two joysticks combined, Christian finally had control over all the manual controls of a drone. I’m going to stop talking about it, and we’re going to show you. Christian, welcome. (Applause) At this point, I&apos;m going to ask everybody to turn off your Bluetooth and put your phones in airplane mode so that you don&apos;t get hit in the face with a drone. (Laughter) How are you feeling, Christian? Christian Bayerlein: Yeah, let&apos;s do it. Conor Russomanno: Awesome. This is a heads-up display that&apos;s showing all of Christian&apos;s biometric data, as well as some information about the drone. On the left here, we can see Christian&apos;s muscle data. Christian is now going to attempt to fly the drone. How are you feeling, Christian, feeling good? CB: Yes. CR: All right. Rock and roll. Let&apos;s take this up for a joyride. Whenever you&apos;re ready. CB: I&apos;m ready. (Applause and cheers) CR: All right, take her up. And now let&apos;s do something we probably shouldn&apos;t do and fly it over the audience. (Laughter) (Cheers and applause) Alright, actually, let’s do this. I&apos;m going to ask for people to call out some commands in the audience. So how about you? Straight forward. Straight forward. (Laughter) Alright. How about you? Man: Up! (Laughter) CR: Not down. Oh, he&apos;s doing what he wants right now. Amazing. (Cheers and applause) Alright, let’s bring it back. And what I&apos;m going to do right now is take control of the controller so that you guys know that there isn&apos;t someone backstage flying this drone. All right, Christian, you&apos;re alright with that? CB: Yeah. CR: Unplug. Forward. And we&apos;re going to land this guy now. CB: I think I was better than you. (Laughter) (Applause) CR: Amazing. (Applause) Now I&apos;m going to unplug it so it doesn&apos;t turn on on its own. Perfect. Christian has repurposed dormant muscles from around his body for extended and augmented interactivity. We have turned those muscles into a generic controller that in this case we&apos;ve mapped into a drone, but what&apos;s really cool is that joystick can be applied to anything. Another thing that&apos;s really cool is that even in individuals who are not living with motor disabilities, there exist dozens of dormant muscles around the body that we can tap into for augmented and expanded control interactivity. And lastly, all the code related to that virtual joystick, we&apos;re going to open source so that you can implement it and improve upon it. There&apos;s three things that have stood out to me from working on this project and many others over the years. One, we cannot conflate the brain with the mind. In order to understand emotions and tensions and the mind overall, we have to measure data from all over the body, not just the brain. Two, open-source technology access and literacy is one way that we can combat the potential ethical challenges we face in introducing neural technology to society. But that&apos;s not enough. We have to do much, much more than that. It&apos;s very important, imperative, that we set up guardrails and design the future that we want to live in. Three. It&apos;s the courage and resilience of trailblazers like Christian who don&apos;t get bogged down by what they can&apos;t do, but instead strive to prove that the impossible is in fact possible. (Applause) And since none of this would have been possible without you, Christian, the stage is yours. CB: Yeah, hi, everybody. Audience: Hi. CB: I&apos;m excited to be here today. I was born with a genetic condition that affects my mobility and requires me to have assistance. Despite my disability, I&apos;m a very happy and fulfilled person. What truly holds me back are not my physical limitations. It&apos;s rather the barriers in the environment. I&apos;m a tech nerd and political activist. I believe that technology can empower disabled people. It can help create a better, more inclusive and accessible world for everyone. This demonstration is a perfect example. We saw what&apos;s possible when cutting edge technology is combined with human curiosity and creativity. So let&apos;s build tools that empower people, applications that break down barriers and systems that unlock a world of possibilities. I think that&apos;s an idea worth spreading. Thank you.

A footballer? An actress? A doctor? Well, when I was a little girl, whenever I was asked the question, my answer was pretty much always the same: &quot;When I grow up, I want to become a man.&quot; To my logic, that was the only way I could live a life free from the suffocating restrictions that women in my birth country of Iran were forced to endure. I&apos;m not quite sure where this line of thinking started from, but a particularly hot summer&apos;s afternoon comes to mind. I was nine years old and along with my family, as we did on every summer holiday, we had traveled to the north of Iran to a little seaside village called Chamkhaleh. For as long as I remember, some of my best childhood memories are of me swimming in the Caspian Sea, paddling in its waves and making sandcastles on its gorgeous beaches. All of those lovely memories, though, were about to be rewritten. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, when a girl turns nine years old, she has legally entered womanhood. And that means having to follow a series of restrictive rules written by men. The most symbolic of which is probably the mandatory wearing of the hijab. That year, my mom had to sit me down and sorrowfully explain that I was now too old to get into the water wearing a swimsuit. Now that I was nine years old, it was illegal. And if I wanted to get into the water like all the other women, I had to go in fully covered from head to toe. I had to go in wearing a pair of trousers, a long-sleeved top and a loose covering called the manto to cover it all. And of course, the headscarf. I still remember the lump in my throat as I set foot in the water. I could no longer feel the fresh coolness of the Caspian Sea against my skin. Instead, my now-wet layers felt itchy and weird. I can still remember feeling the watchful eyes of the morality police, the so-called morality police, making sure that me and the other girls were not showing too much hair or too much skin to, God forbid, arouse the men. It was as if my former freedoms were washing away with every tide and flow of the water. Next, I&apos;m deep in the water. I was a good swimmer, but my layers were so heavy and restrictive. I tried to gasp for air, but my headscarf kept blocking my face. The tides were pulling me further and further out. I could see my mom and dad on the beach, I tried to call for help, but they couldn&apos;t hear me. Perhaps my voice was drowned out by the roaring engines of the bikes that the morality police were patrolling the beaches. The tides continued, pulling me further and further out and hopelessness started creeping in. Next, I wake up on the beach, cold, wet, shivering. It turns out my father had just spotted my struggles in time and had rushed in to get me. That was the last time I ever set foot in my beloved Caspian Sea. Growing up in the Islamic Republic of Iran, every day it felt as though I was going through the same experience but in different ways. And looking at the women in my life, they seemed to be going through the same thing too, in different ways. And the older I grew, the further out the tides of oppression, injustice, inequality felt like they were pulling me in. Wherever I turned, shame, fear and especially hopelessness were ever-present. Women in Iran are second-class citizens. They have almost no access when it comes to some of the most basic rights like divorce, custody of children and even travel. They have no legal protection against sexual harassment and domestic violence. They are not allowed to sing in public or have sex outside of marriage, and they&apos;re only allowed to show their face and hand in public. In the 20 years or so since I almost drowned, nothing has changed. Iranian women have been adrift in a vast sea of oppression. Their only way out, for those who could, is to leave themselves at the mercy of people smugglers, set out on dangerous journeys in hope of finding safety in a land far away. That&apos;s what happened to me. Age 12, along with my mom and my baby sister, we escaped Iran. And after years of living in refugee camps across Europe, sleeping rough and being at the mercy of some very, very dodgy people smugglers, we finally found safe haven here, in the UK. For my friends and family who stayed behind, there was little hope for change. And so when in September last year, 22-year-old Mahsa Jina Amini stepped out of the metro onto the bustling streets of Tehran, there was little reason to expect a change to the status quo. The same way that it&apos;s happened to my own mother and many other women I know, Mahsa was arrested by the so-called morality police because, in their opinion, she was showing more hair than they deemed acceptable. Three days later, Mahsa died in police custody. This time, though, something changed. Thanks to the power of social media and the brave journalists working hard on the ground, the news of Mahsa&apos;s killing wasn&apos;t drowned out in the regime&apos;s relentless propaganda. In the same way that the unjust killing of George Floyd ignited the Black Lives Matter movement, the unjust killing of Mahsa Amini ignited the biggest anti-regime protests across Iran since the formation of the Islamic Republic in 1979. For the first time in decades, women in Iran are finally daring to defy the strict morality laws. In a fight for equality and dignity, they are taking off their headscarves, burning them in bonfires, and some are cutting off their hair. They&apos;re chanting &quot;Zan. Zendegi. Azadi.&quot; &quot;Woman, Life, Freedom.&quot; Furious crowds are calling for democracy, for freedom of speech, for freedom of expression, whilst many others are calling for the fall of the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. Khamenei is Iran&apos;s spiritual leader and has the final say over all government matters. For the first time in a very, very long time, there seems to be hope in the air. Hope that perhaps change in Iran is possible. And that&apos;s exactly why the crackdown has been so brutal and deadly. These are the faces of the protesters who fought for freedom but will not live to see it. Since the protest began nearly five months ago, around 500 people have been killed. Nearly 80 of those children. Around 18,000 protesters have been arrested. And there are reports of psychological, physical and sexual torture in prisons. There has been a series of hasty trials, forced confessions and public executions of the protesters. The authoritarian regime of Iran is clearly desperate to kill any and all hope because they know that for as long as we remain hopeless, we&apos;ll resign to their oppression and injustice. But as history has shown over and over again, the light of hope emerges from the depth of darkness. Hope is angry. It&apos;s defiant. Hope is dangerous. Hope is standing its ground on the streets of Iran, chanting &quot;Woman, Life, Freedom.&quot; Hope is in political prisons, biding its time, sustaining those in shackles. Hope has now spread to the four corners of my birth country. As a journalist, I can&apos;t travel to Iran. But as my sisters in Tehran, Mashhad, Shiraz, Baluchistan, Kurdistan, shomal, jonoob, shargh, gharb, all over Iran have done, I, too, I&apos;m going to cut my hair to show my solidarity with the movement. (Cheers and applause) (Cheers and applause continues) Thank you. (Applause continues) (Applause ends) Thank you. Audience: Freedom for women! (Cheers) SZ: This hair, for too long, has been intertwined with religion and politics. But I say with my sisters in Iran: no more. And I say with them: Women, to reclaim our rights. (Applause and cheers) Life, for the lives unjustly taken. (Applause) Freedom, for the liberation of my people. (Applause) I stand here with my hair in my hand, in hope of a future where no little girl has to wish she were a man because she&apos;s terrified that she might drown every day. (Applause) Yes, the crackdown is brutal. And yes, there might not be a solution inside yet. But the only thing that can help create and sustain one is hope. Sorry. (Cheers and applause) The only thing that can help create and sustain one is hope. And every single one of us can take a step and play our part. I&apos;m standing here speaking to you now. Many non-Iranians and Iranians outside of Iran have been signing petitions, going to protest, putting pressure on their governments so that in turn, they put pressure on the Iranian regime and government. For the past few months, I&apos;ve been speaking to protesters inside of Iran, and they tell me how much it matters to them that we on the outside stay informed and engaged. So let&apos;s try our best to make certain that those of us on the shore let those at sea know that we see them, that we hear their cries. Thank you for taking a step towards a future where freedom is not just a dream, but a reality. Not just for women, but for everyone. And not just in Iran, but everywhere. Thank you.

have shaped our world in the last 12 months. I'm Angus Hervey, and this is the news. We begin our broadcast with a story that has dominated headlines this past year, Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The war has inflicted a terrible human toll, plunging millions into an unrelenting conflict, dramatically upending international politics and sparking turmoil in energy markets around the world. Perhaps the only thing scarier than a war like this is the prospect of our planet being ruined by climate change. However, on that front, the news has been somewhat better. Specifically as a result of this crisis, the global fight against climate change has accelerated. In response to Putin's attempt to use gas and oil as weapons, Europe has doubled down on green energy. Last year, for the first time ever, wind and solar overtook gas, nuclear or coal as the continent's largest source of electricity. And analysts say that as a result of the war, Europe's timeline for ditching fossil fuels has accelerated by up to a decade. Staying with the climate, in the United States, a new law has committed hundreds of billions of dollars of investment into renewables and electric vehicles, putting the country on track to getting 80 percent of its electricity from carbon-free sources by the end of this decade. And in the race to build more clean energy, China is way ahead of both Europe and the United States. The country is now installing enough solar panels every day to cover an area the size of New York's Central Park. At the current rate, China will reach its climate targets years ahead of schedule. The energy revolution has arrived. Global fossil fuel emissions are now predicted to peak within less than two years, and the International Energy Agency says that wind, water and sunshine will become the planet's largest sources of electricity by 2025. To global health. Where many countries are still struggling in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, less widely reported is the news that last year, eight countries eliminated at least one neglected tropical disease. Top of that list, Togo, which became the first country to eliminate four of those diseases, including trachoma, the world's most common infectious cause of blindness. Go, Togo. (Laughter) Today, almost 600 million fewer people require treatment for these diseases than in 2010. It's thanks to the work of tens of thousands of uncelebrated heroes of public health. It means that in just over a decade, a significant portion of humanity has been liberated from a devastating burden of suffering and from death. There's also hope on the horizon in the fight against malaria. Last year, a new vaccine designed by the University of Oxford was shown to be safe and incredibly effective. Four days ago, Ghana became the first country to license that vaccine for distribution. Nigeria followed that up eight hours ago. Both countries are now going to vaccinate children under the age of three. This is a world-changing treatment. It offers us genuine hope that we may finally be able to eradicate one of humanity's biggest killers, a scourge that has plagued our species for thousands of years. (Applause) Imagine if this was the news. (Laughter) That along with all of the usual death and disaster and division, we also got to hear these, the stories of hope and healing. But not just another dog on a surfboard. The thing is, this is the news. These stories, they're happening. It's just that we don't hear as much about them. But when you find them, the world can suddenly feel like a very different place. Let's turn now to some environmental news where pollution and degradation continue to push Earth's ecosystems past their breaking point. However, in the last year, humanity has begun to respond. Four months ago, the countries of the United Nations came together to agree on a global pact to protect 30 percent of the planet by 2030. And just weeks ago, after nearly two decades of negotiations, they agreed on the first-ever legal framework for regulation on and protection of life on the high seas. (Applause) The tides are beginning to turn. Here’s conference president Rena Lee announcing what Greenpeace has called the greatest conservation victory of all time. (Video) Ladies and gentlemen ... The ship has reached the shore. (Cheers and applause) AH: More good news for the environment. Since the beginning of last year, we've seen the expansion of protected waters around the Galapagos, the creation of an enormous marine sanctuary west of Australia, and a provisional agreement between Canada's government and First Nations to create the Tang.ɢwan–ḥačxwiqak–Tsig̱is Marine Protected Area that will be Canada’s largest MPA. That is just off the coast of West Vancouver. That's less than 150 kilometers from where we all are right now. Last year, Argentina created a national park around one of its biggest saltwater lakes and wetlands. Earlier this year, Ecuador created one of the largest reserves in the Amazon, in one of the most biodiverse places on the planet. And last month, the largest river restoration project in United States history kicked off on the Klamath River, led by the Yurok people of California. (Applause) None of it is enough yet. But these are big victories. They show us that destruction is not inevitable and that nature will recover if we can just give it the opportunity. This report just in now from our political and social affairs editor. Last year saw some significant setbacks for human rights, most notably in the United States, where for many, it feels like intolerance and polarization are on the rise. Globally, however, it's a very different story. Since the beginning of 2022, countries have abolished the death penalty, six countries have ended child marriage, four countries have banned conversion therapy, four countries have legalized homosexuality, and 11 countries have actually strengthened reproductive rights. (Applause) That includes India, which passed a law guaranteeing access to safe abortion for every single woman. (Cheers and applause) And Spain, which also protected transgender rights and became the first country in Europe to provide paid menstrual leave. (Applause) Oh, and sorry, I forgot to mention, Slovenia, Cuba and Mexico all passed legislation on same-sex marriage and adoption. Three times -- three times as many countries now grant those rights to all of their citizens compared to a decade ago. (Applause) The fight for equality continues. But progress is happening even if we don't hear much about it. In the last year, humanity has moved closer to a world where everyone is free to choose and free to love. On that note, let's cross now to some more economic news. Many will have missed last year's report from the United Nations that India lifted 415 million people out of poverty between 2006 and 2021. Despite some of that progress being set back by the pandemic, that still means that on average, every day for the last 16 years, a soccer stadium full of people escaped poverty, the worst kinds of deprivation. That is one of the greatest news stories of all time. (Applause) Let's cross now to our correspondent in the field, Angus Hervey, to get some more of these and some other stories from around the world. Angus, over to you. (Laughter) Thank you very much, Angus. Well, I'm here in Brazil where the new Ministry of Indigenous people is bringing much needed food, hope, relief and aid to the country's indigenous communities. They've already deployed the military to remove tens of thousands of illegal miners and restore justice. Zimbabwe. I'm here with the Akashinga, an all-female army of wildlife rangers there. These women, many of them, are survivors of domestic violence, but they have become formidable warriors after years in the field -- Their military trainers say they're more hardcore than a lot of the world's special forces. And they're really changing the face of conservation here and the other four countries where they're operating. They have hundreds of their members out there now. They're uplifting their communities, bringing down poaching rates dramatically and contributing to a huge rebound in wild animal populations. (Applause) And finally in Bangladesh, where thousands of newly-trained midwives are bringing hope and healing to those who need it the most. Since 2012, they've helped bring down the child mortality rate here by almost 50 percent. It is a powerful testament to the work of midwives everywhere and a reminder of just what can be achieved through education and a commitment to improving the lives of others. Angus, back to you now in the studio. (Applause) Thanks very much, Angus. That was Angus Hervey there reporting on everything from everywhere all at once. (Laughter) Let's turn now to science and technology and what many say is not just the biggest news story of the year, but perhaps the most important technological breakthrough of our lifetimes. ChatGPT has taken the world by storm -- (Laughter) becoming the quickest technology uptake in human history. The power of artificial intelligence is incredible, but there are also very real reasons to be concerned about its effect on systems of power and its impact on jobs and society. As we wrestle with these dilemmas, though, let us not forget that in the last 12 months, humanity has repeatedly shown our resilience, inventiveness, our capacity for expanding our knowledge and ability ... to rise to meet our greatest challenges. Nine months ago, we received the first images from the golden honeycombed 18 beryllium mirrors of the James Webb Telescope, unlocking new secrets from the furthest reaches of the cosmos. Seven months ago, we smashed a spacecraft into an asteroid and altered its orbit, confirming a newfound ability to create planetary defense systems against earthbound objects. Four months ago, we used freaking laser beams (Laughter) to recreate the conditions inside of a star, achieving more energy out of a nuclear fusion reaction than we put in. It's a milestone in our quest to provide clean, limitless and affordable energy. And then, just days later, scientists in London announced that they had used a new form of CRISPR called base-editing to hot-wire immune cells and clear the body of a 13-year-old girl named Alyssa from an incurable form of leukemia. (Applause) It's an incredible medical breakthrough. The first use of a revolutionary new type of treatment that may go on to save millions of lives in the future. So why is it then that outside medical and scientific circles, almost nobody has heard that story? Why are we so familiar with all of the stories that make us feel scared or sad or angry, but so many of these stories come to us as a surprise? Why are we so good at reporting bad news but so bad at reporting good news? That question is something that I spend a lot of time thinking about. I'm the editor of the Future Crunch newsletter. We share stories of progress and what I've learned after eight years of doing this work is that progress is never a straight line. Far too many still suffer in poverty, from disease and are trapped by conflict. The struggle for equality and the fight for justice continues in so many places in the world. We still have so much work to do, to get done. We know that geopolitical tensions are rising. Climate change is genuinely scary and we are still destroying too many parts of our planet. But when we only tell the stories of doom, we fail to see the stories of possibility. The hundreds of examples of progress in human rights, rising living standards, public health victories, clean energy breakthroughs, technological magic, ecological restoration and the countless extraordinary acts of kindness that take place on this planet every day. I believe that if we want to change the story of the human race in the 21st century, we have to start changing the stories that we tell ourselves. And we have to remember that hope isn't a noun. It's a verb. It's not something that we have or something that we're given. It's something that we do. Millions of people around the world chose to hope in the last 12 months and then rolled up their sleeves to get it done. Perhaps it's time for the rest of us to do the same. I’m Angus Hervey, and let's make this the news. (Applause)\n",



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   My passion for the poetics of everyday language began at 5 pm on Saturdays, at my abuela's dining room, at a table full of loud, unstoppable women. My five aunts plus my mom’s five aunts, all smoking, some in their bras, some in their “rulos,” all complaining about the ineptitude of their husbands or the rising prices at the grocery store. Some used grand gestures, pointing with their mouths. Others made up words. Some yelled, some cried. They were all narrating a similar experience, but each one of them put her own twist to her story. Each one used a different word choice, a different rhythm. My mom complained in silence, shaking her head and sighing. My Tía T used energized curse words, 'That hijo de su madre,' she would say. 'That good-for-nothing son of a bitch.' (Laughter) My great aunt shut her eyes, drank coffee and pointed at God. 'Diosito! What is wrong with this man?' Each one putting a different tune, a different music to her story. As a kid, I sat among them in awe, marveled at how elastic, how expansive, how infinite language felt at the dining table, how fun. If my aunts didn't know a word, they would just make it up, laugh about it, and stick it to their husbands' nicknames. (Laughter) The word would then be tossed around and eventually become part of our intimate, familiar vocabulary. My family is originally from the coast of Colombia, which is a region known for its magnificent storytellers, its grand words, a region where made-up words are the norm, where music and rhythm are essential to speaking. I inherited the creative tongue from my aunts. In Colombia, I was a loud, energized sucker. I wouldn’t shut up, I made up words, too. But the moment I moved to the States and landed in Miami, all that energy and love for language disappeared. It was here that I had my first encounter with language hierarchy. I was 15 years old and we were reading 'Romeo and Juliet' in English class. I begged and prayed that I wouldn't be called to read Juliet's part because it was long and I didn't know what most of the words meant. But of course I was called to read Juliet's part. My heart sank. When I said I didn't want to, the teacher responded I will lose participation point if I didn't. OK, I had to read it. I tried to push my tongue in impossible ways, tried to echo the sound that I have been listening around me. But I butchered all the words. Everyone around me laughed and the teacher just stood there silently. I remember clenching that desk, wanting to disappear, wishing to be made small, invisible. I went home that day and told my mom I wasn't going back to school. The laughter and ridicule in school created deep fear and anxiety inside me. I spoke differently and this clearly was wrong. It saddened me that I couldn’t access that part of myself that was so excited about language because my way of speaking, with an accent or inventing words or pronouncing words as I heard them, was deemed wrong. I said 'sans giving' instead of Thanksgiving. I mix both languages: 'I have to 'plancha' it.' 'Give me the 'trapo.'' 'Mom wants her 'chanclas.'' ''Oye ye estas' ready?' (Laughter) I remember staying up late to practice pronouncing words so the kids at school wouldn't make fun of me. I hated myself for not fitting in, not realizing that there was a hierarchy much bigger than me at play here. I felt I was the one who was wrong. And it wasn't only me who was being corrected and laughed at. I saw teachers correct some of my peers, usually anyone who wasn't white, shaming immigrant kids for saying 'quota' instead of 'quarter,' “la pena bota” instead of “peanut butter,” “con flae” instead of “cornflakes.” (Laughter) It seemed all of us were crossing an invisible language boundary. A boundary policed by the teacher and maintained by the students' laughter. Now let's take a step back and see what's really happening here. We tend to think of language, in this case English, as a closed circle, where all of us English speakers exist. A closed circle where correct English is elevated at the center. When someone says something in another language, we know it is outside of that circle. When someone speaks English with an accent or without proper grammar, we know it is inside the circle, but not correct, not at the center. So we push both the language and the people who speak it to the margins. We really don't consider how looking at language as a closed circle with a solid center excludes so many people, so many ways of speaking and making sense of the world. How this in turn creates a hierarchy of language. I learned about how this hierarchy isolates people the hard way, by watching the condescension of cashiers at the grocery store every time my mom wouldn't pronounce things right. By watching my mother shrink at every joke at her mispronunciation until she stopped trying to speak English altogether and would just sit quietly in shame. My mother, who back in Colombia will call the manager, the owner if needed, when her coupons wouldn't scan because “This rice is two for one, señorita, it says it right here. Llámame el manager.” (Laughter) I can still see her, hand on hips, negating with her head, articulating like homegirl got a degree in bargaining studies. (Laughter) My mom, the discounts queen, would not leave until she felt justice was served between coupons and rice. Proudly bragged to her sisters about it later over coffee. I walked alongside her with a warm grounding feeling. My mom could take anyone. When we moved to the States, her sense of being a valued human being deserving of respect was destroyed by ridicule and condescension. As I slowly became aware of this hierarchy, I realized that my mom, my sister, my friends and me, we were all close to the bottom. We were on the margins of this circle and therefore of society. We couldn't reach the center because of our ethnic and cultural background. We sat in shame because our way of speaking wasn't as 'refined.' I realize also that this hierarchy permeates all spaces and it's a gatekeeper when it comes to accessing resources and opportunities. I wasn't hired on several jobs because I couldn’t speak “correct English,” the managers letting me know, 'We're just a little worried the customers won't understand you.' My writing also hasn't been published in many places because it mixes both languages and this is seen as less than, not pure. My writing has been ridiculed in many academic workshops where several times white writers have made fun of my use of Spanglish out loud, rereading the text for all to hear, questioning its legitimacy as real literature. My abilities as a student, a worker, my value as a human being, has been questioned over and over again. And yet. There's beauty and connection in these marginal spaces. For people in the margins, language creates cohesion between us. That 'different' way of speaking is a secret door only some of us have access to. A door to an underworld of language freedom. This world begins for me not in Miami, but in the former 'Esta Noche' gay Latino bar here, in San Francisco. (Cheers and applause) Ten years ago, I moved to San Francisco in search of my freak tribe and found the “queenas” tucked in a dingy bar on 16th Street, ironing their wigs and filling up their bras. Queena -- it’s a blend between “queen” and “reina,” Spanish for queen. Queena. (Laughter) It was at 'Esta Noche' that I learned about the long history of LGBT people creating new words to reflect our own histories, our own realities. It was here that my passion for language bloomed again. The story begins with the words. 'Fierce,' 'perra,' 'sissy marica,' 'come here, butch papi.' Here, Spanglish blends with queer slang as drag queens take the center stage to the roar of the crowd. Here, there's unapologetic invention and creativity. It is not only a mix of two languages, but a constructing, a shaping of new words to reflect our own bodies, our own gender, the ways that we come together. Here, you don't have to be a man or a woman. You don't have to be gay or straight. Here, the categories for gender are infinite, as are the words to describe body parts, sexual orientation, feelings. Here, language lets her hair down, 'se suelta las trenzas.' Gloria Trevi plays in the background as the next drag queen gets introduced as a non-binary femme daddy mermaid of the revolution. (Laughter) We all snap our fingers, 'Get it! Mami!' I stand next to someone with hot pink hair and a T-shirt that reads 'Gender queer cyborg.' (Laughter) Boys in crop tops yell, 'Yes, perras.' They sashay up and down, twirling on the dance floor. 'Serve,' someone says, “Bring it,” someone responds, “¡Esa!” we all roar. We wear glitter on our bodies and glitter on our language. We feel seen. Our realities take up space and therefore we experience a sense of belonging. We feel less alone, connected. We add a sense of magic and possibility to the world. We make it less boring and more inviting. Now think of the ways that you speak, the words that you use. Think of how you have borrowed words from your parents, your friends. This is how you know you belong to those circles, right? By echoing back that language. The place where you grow up shows up in your accent, how you punctuate, how you use your vowels. This is your very own language wardrobe. Each one of us has a different wardrobe depending on our background, our ethnicity, our access to education, our immigration status, the places that we come from. Now consider how some of the most glittery, the most creative language wardrobes are erased, stigmatized or only seen as spectacles. But what if, alongside the language wardrobes we see and hear every day, we also allowed for the freaky, the weird, the ones that we don't understand. Wouldn't our world be that much more interesting? Wouldn't our notion of what it means to be human expand? What would happen if these different ways of using language, of mixing English with other languages, of making up words, were not considered less than, but instead, manifestations of creative brilliance? People are, after all, inventing, creating, mixing. What would happen if, for instance, we didn’t see English and Spanish as mutually exclusive, as two separate languages, but as open circles touching each other? Imagine legislation written in Spanglish or traffic signs written in queer slang. 'Men at Werk.' (Laughter) Imagine textbooks where children also learn words such as “gender queer” and “queena,” where they learn how to write, “Ahí te guacho mami.” That playfulness will seep into our own lives, lighten our worlds. Maybe we would treat each other better. Our daily interactions will be kinder, less uncomfortable and fearful around those who speak differently. Less isolating and damaging for those of us on the margins. I want to invite us to suspend the idea of a 'correct' way of speaking, a 'correct' way of using language. And let's allow for those rhythms, those incorrect words at the margins to rise up. Let's listen. Recognize the glitter in each other's way of speaking. Activate that kid at the dining table who is in awe and curious about language and its world. That child listening to her tías drop their 'Ay, my goodness,' as they drop their “Ajá, baby, come pa acá.” Their endless possibility to bring surprise and magic through language. Let's dance 'pegadito' with language. Let's tune into the ways that each one of us speaks. The many different ways that each one of us make sense of the world. Thank you. (Applause and cheers)\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          You’ve heard the phrase “move fast and break things.” Facebook made it famous. But really, Mark just made the mistake of saying it out loud and putting it on company posters. By the way, Mark and I are not on a first-name basis. (Laughter) But sometimes using the first names of our leaders reminds us that leadership is a practice of imperfect humans leading imperfect humans. That's why it's so hard. How's it going, Elon? (Laughter) 'Move fast and break things' is still a widely held belief that we can either make progress or take care of each other, one or the other. That a certain amount of wreckage is the price we have to pay for inventing the future. My wife and I have spent the last decade helping companies clean up this wreckage. And one of the main lessons from our work is that the trade-off at the heart of this worldview is false. The most effective leaders we know solve problems at an accelerated pace while also taking responsibility for the success and the well-being of their customers and employees and shareholders. They move fast and fix things. (Applause) Now, what's come out of our work is something of a playbook for fixing problems quickly, whether it's a broken company culture or a struggling friendship. And so what I want to do with you today is invite you to try on this playbook over the course of an imaginary week. So how this is going to work is I'm going to give you an agenda for each day of the week, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. You see where this is going. And then I want you to go home and try it and see how much progress you can make. Does that sound reasonable? OK. I'm seeing some signs of consent, thank you. Start by thinking of a problem that you're having right now that involves at least one other person, your kids, your co-founders, your customers, etc. Now in our imaginary week, it's now Monday morning. Now Monday morning, it's a bad rap, but we like to think of it as the gift of renewal that comes around every seven days. (Laughter) On Monday, your task is to figure out what your real problem is, which may not be the problem that you thought you had just a minute ago. Because here's the thing. As human beings, we tend to be overconfident in the quality of our thoughts. Particularly when it comes to diagnosing our own problems. 'My investors don't get it.' 'My Gen Z employees are entitled.' 'My dog is mad at me.' Let's find out if you're right. The thing that's going to help you out most today is your own curiosity. So turn that original diagnosis, 'My Gen Z employees are entitled,' into a question rather than a statement. 'What's going on with my Gen Z employees?' Now your next move sounds obvious, but you might be surprised to learn how infrequently people actually do it. Talk directly to the other people who have a stake in your problem. Ask some things you might not normally ask in polite company, things that require a little courage on your part. Now, as I look around the room, and I'm being a little presumptuous, I suspect this is going to be hard for some of you. I get it, I come from a very WASPy family. There were three approved topics of conversation: the pets, the weather, and Tom Brokaw for some reason. (Laughter) But sometimes just a single brave conversation can reveal an entirely new structure to your problem. Some of you will discover, for example, that you have a role to play in creating the problem that you're now solving this week. Instead of your Gen Z employees being entitled, for example, you might discover it's you who feels entitled. To burn them out and pay them less than what they're worth, simply because that was the broken work contract that you put up with at their age. (Applause) I'm just spitballing up here. (Laughter) But what I do know is that whatever it is you learn today, you're going to be closer to understanding what's really getting in the way of the relationship or the organization or the life you want. Alright, excellent first day, everyone. Get some rest. Now it's Tuesday. On Tuesday, your job is to run a smart experiment in how to solve your problem. Start by creating a good-enough plan to strengthen the relationship at the center of it. Now, a good-enough plan is distinct from a perfect plan, which is an elusive, fantastical creature that has never actually been spotted in the wild. We tend to think about problems through the lens of trust. So one prompt that often helps on Tuesday is what could you do tomorrow to build more trust than you did today? For one team we were working with, they decided to stop texting each other about each other in the middle of meetings. (Laughter) Someone else we were coaching decided that it was time to come clean to his cofounders, that he was ready to move on from the business. Another leader decided that it was time for him to take full responsibility for the unintended harms of a product that he'd designed. Is your good-enough plan going to work? Probably not. Statistically, not on the first try. That's why I'm giving you all a week to figure it out. But also to make the inevitable, unavoidable mistakes. The purpose of Tuesday is not to get it right. The purpose of Tuesday is to learn. It's to get into the sandbox of your life and give yourself permission to play. Alright, go and have the adult beverage of your choice, which you have definitely earned. Now it’s Wednesday. On Wednesday, your job is to do something that adults generally don't like to do. It's to make new friends. But the research is really clear. That whatever problem you're trying to solve this week, you're going to be better at solving it with people who don't already think like you do. I know you've heard this before many times. But today is your chance to practice. So describe your good-enough plan, the one you came up with yesterday, to someone whose life experience has been materially different from yours. If you've been at the company for a decade, talk to someone who started last week. If you're a white partner, talk to a Black partner. If you're queer like me, talk to the straightest person you can find. (Laughter) Contrary to what you may have heard recently, they're everywhere. (Laughter) (Applause) And when you're done with that conversation, have another conversation with someone else who's different from you on some other gorgeous dimension of the human experience. This is going to take you all day, and some of you are going to be surprised to discover that it’s your favorite day of the week. At the end of the day, you’re going to be smiling, and your good-enough plan is going to be an even-better plan. OK, now it's Thursday, good morning. It's Thursday, you're unstoppable. Thursday is storytelling day. As humans, we need stories to make sense of change, to find our place in the script of it. Stories also help us to activate all the other people around us whose help we're going to need with that change. Stories have three parts: past, present, future. We often skip over that past part in moments of big change. We did some work with Uber when it was going through its very public crisis in leadership. And when the new guy came in, the new CEO, and hosted his first all-hands meeting, he committed to retain the edge that had made Uber a force of nature. Now, this line was met with thunderous applause. The applause of relief. He also joined in a standing ovation for his predecessor, who also happened to be in the room that day. I was so struck by the grace of this choice. And that's the word I want you to bring to your own storytelling. Listen, Uber had serious problems to solve, as anyone reading the news could figure out. But the people in that room had built something extraordinary, and they had something real to lose in an uncertain future. Instead of setting himself up as some kind of company savior, the new guy honored that complicated truth. Honor the complicated truth of the people around you, the ones who aren't so sure about all your big plans. Then tell us why you want to change things. Finally, tell us about the future in vivid and specific language. Tell us what it's going to feel like when your story becomes our reality. Alright, it's Friday. It's Friday, and you're almost done, I promise. The payoff of Friday, the payoff of this whole week of hard work is that you now get to move fast because you're far less likely to break things. So do everything you decided to do over the last week, but now do it with a sense of urgency. Urgency releases the energy in the system. It makes it clear to everyone that you take the problem seriously. So whatever administrative hurdles, whatever unproductive process is in the way of taking action today, just strip it out, just refuse to tolerate it. People ask us all the time about the optimal timing for big change. And our answer is almost always the same. How about now? Now seems good. Take action now, and then learn from whatever happens next. And at the end of this day, at the end of this week, your even-better plan has a chance of being a great plan. Alright, that’s it. That's your week. Congratulations, you did it, as you rest and recover, which is essential. I want to leave you with one final thought. I spend my time helping leaders to change and evolve. And no one has ever said to me, 'I wish I had taken longer and done less.' (Laughter) What I do hear again and again is the opposite. And so my invitation to you today is to practice. To practice taking less time to do more of the things that will make your relationships and your teams and your organizations stronger. And to be honest, you have my blessing to take longer than a week to get it done. What I don't want you to do is to take months or even years, which tends to be our default timeline for solving hard problems. Most of our problems deserve a more urgent response. Most of our problems deserve a metabolic rate that honors the frustration and the mediocrity and the real pain of the status quo for some of you. Thank you. (Laughter and applause) So whether your name is Mark or Elon or Chris -- thank you for having me -- or Anne, find out what happens when you move fast and fix things and decide that the moment that matters most is right now.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        People ask me all the time, 'What is the toughest part about growing up in the foster care system?' I was an 11-month-old baby when I was placed in foster care. By the time I was in the third grade and I was about nine, I was adopted. I was given a new forever family, but it was far from a loving home. I was consistently referred to as the N-word. The refrigerator couldn’t be touched. She cared more about that check than she did me. By the time I was 15, I was sick of it. I knew that I needed to take matters into my own hands. So after watching 'Law and Order,' the show -- (Laughter) Thank God for Olivia Benson. (Laughter) I realized something. I needed to get the evidence of what was happening to me. So I took a recorder and I took some tape and I taped that recorder to my chest and I got the evidence that I needed to get back into the foster care system. Even without abuse, foster care is a tough experience. You don't know what's actually going to happen to you. You're placed with a stranger and you're expected to become family. But if you don't fit in, if you act up a little bit too much, you will find yourself in a new home with new school, new rules, new everything. When I was placed back in foster care at 15, I thought that that was the end of my storm. But it was just the beginning of the next storm. I didn’t go back home, went to a few different homes, but unlike many, I was placed in a non-profit program where I got ready to live on my own. The foster care system is not doing a good job of raising children. Unsupported foster youth are two to three times more likely to have negative outcomes related to homelessness, incarceration, being sexually trafficked. The mental toll is severe. I want you to think about war veterans. Foster youth are two times more likely than war veterans to experience and suffer from PTSD. This is why I started Think of Us, because this is the current result of the foster care system. It's designed wrong. So we approach problems differently. We actually engage those who are impacted. We ask questions, we listen. We take the collective experience of thousands of people who are impacted and turn that into data and insights that then we know what are the most broken pieces of the system and where we can start to redesign it. We work with leaders across the entire sector, people with lived experience, to co-design new solutions. And then we do whatever it takes to implement those solutions. I want to give you an example. We overwhelmingly heard from teenage foster youth that they were being misplaced in group homes. The system was acting like they have nowhere to place these children. Turned around, we sent our researchers out. And what they were able to reveal was that the majority of those children actually had extended family members that they could have lived with. On top of that, that they were having these very traumatic experiences. We collected those voices and lifted them up. The vibration of the truth of what they shared with us was so strong that it helped inform litigation brought on by the United States Department of Justice, the Civil Rights Division. It helped inform an investigation into institutional abuse by these for-profit group homes by the United States Senate. It helped inform an amicus brief that went to the United States Supreme Court. That is the power of lived experience. The key to transformation is lived experience. For the past eight years, we've listened to thousands of young people. And it's become so clear that there's one key thing that we need to transform. And that is who children in foster care get to live with. Kin. We believe that kin can transform the foster care experience. Kinship care is when a child goes ahead and is able to live with an extended family member or an adult that they have already known, an adult who loves them. That adult can be a church member, a close family friend. And what we now know is that research is showing that when children are placed with kin, they fare way better, from mental health, to stability, to graduating high school on time. And yet only 35 percent of young people in the foster care system are actually placed with kin. But it doesn't have to be this way. In one state, in partnership, right, we went in and we implemented some simple solutions, like, let's ask young people which adults in their family they should live with. (Laughter) I wish I told you something better. That is one solution. (Laughter) We ask, we went ahead and like, require social workers to get extra approvals if they're going to place you outside of kin. The result? The initial placement with young people in the foster care system in a situation where they were living with kin, rose from three percent to over 40 percent in just two years. (Applause) In another state, we looked at a county, we looked at that state, and in one county they were able to figure out how to place over 80 percent of those children with kin. So the idea that young people don't have adults in their life who can step up, is not true. Here's what this shows. That when the system believes that children should be raised in family, guess what? That the children are actually raised in family. For me, I was almost 30 years old when my sister called me while I was visiting New York City. She told me that in just three hours that my father's side of the family was going to be having a family reunion. They didn't know I existed. And I didn't know that they existed. And so I raced over to Harlem, walked through that park, looking at every single family, wondering which one was mine. When I finally arrived, words can't describe that moment. They were kind. They were accepting. They were curious about who I was. And then about 90 minutes in, everything changed. I discovered that I had four aunts and uncles who had been fostering longer than I had been alive. In that moment, all I can do was go into my pocket, pull out my phone, open Google Maps and GPS to my last foster home. Fifty-eight miles away. My whole life, I was always 58 miles and a couple questions away from being raised by people who could have loved me, by people who could have been my family. The worst part about this is that my story is actually not unique. That every single year hundreds of thousands of children are entering the foster care system and they're not being placed with family. And again, it actually doesn't have to be this way. The system spends over 30 billion dollars on less than one million families a year. That is more than enough to make sure we find family, we support them, and that every child is living in a loving family situation. Right now, there's a big systems change opportunity, a federal decision that would make it super easy to have people who are related to a child step up and say, 'I'm willing to do this' and get that support. If approved, we would see three billion dollars shift from traditional foster care to kinship care. So when we work on these crazy ideas like “let’s make kinship care the norm,” it is actually possible. And I want to leave you with three things to think about. Number one, I came on this stage with, like, a very simple idea. Children should be raised in family. How can we replace the majority of foster care with kinship care? Number two. How do we center those who have been impacted, those who have lived experience, in making kinship care the new norm as we design it and implement it? And the last part, I want to tell you, we need some help. We need some allies. We need you to become advocates with us. And you don't have to be a foster care expert to know the power of family and to know that every child should be being raised by family or someone that they know when it's possible. I will say this. I truly believe we're at this pivot point. And then if we push just a little bit harder in this very moment, that we can actually live in a new reality where when children have to come into the foster care system, that the first thing that is looked at is extended family, it's people that they know. And if we are able to achieve that, we will literally be able to ensure that millions of children will come off of that school bus, go into their homes, look at family members, people that they know, and say, 'I am loved.' Thank you. (Applause and cheers)\n",

If left untreated, it kills about half of those it infects. It can spread through pretty much every fluid your body makes, including blood and sweat. Even the dead can transmit the disease, often doing so at their own funerals. On December 26th, 2013, a two-year-old boy in southern Guinea got sick. Just two days later, he died. It took local doctors working  with the international community four months to discover  that Ebola was to blame, largely because it had never before been detected outside of Central Africa. In those four months, Ebola gained  a head start that would prove devastating. The outbreak lasted two years and mushroomed into the largest Ebola epidemic in recorded history. More than 28,000 people contracted the disease and over 11,000 died. In 2013, Guinea had no formal emergency response system, few trained contact tracers, and no rapid tests, border screenings, or licensed vaccine for Ebola. After that epidemic, Guinea, with the support of the US  and other international partners, completely overhauled  their epidemic response system. And in January 2021, that system faced its first real test. It started when a nurse in southern Guinea developed a headache, vomiting, and fever. A few days later, she died. As dictated by traditional burial practices, her family prepared her body  for the funeral. Within a week, the nurse’s husband and other family members started experiencing symptoms. Health officials suspected Ebola much quicker than in 2013 and ordered tests. They came back positive, and Guinea activated its epidemic  alert system the next day. Then, lots of things happened very quickly. Guinea’s National Agency  for Health Security activated 38 district-level  emergency operations centers, as well as a national one. Teams of epidemiologists and contact tracers began the painstaking job of figuring out exactly who was exposed and when, generating a list of 23 initial contacts that quickly grew to over 1,100. Advanced rapid testing capacity spun  up in the city where the outbreak started. At Guinea’s borders with Liberia and Cote d’Ivoire, public health workers screened more than 2 million travelers. A large-scale vaccination campaign was started. And, finally, more than 900 community mobilizers alerted people of the outbreak and suggested alternative burial practices that were acceptable to the community and reduced the risk of spreading Ebola. Thanks to all these measures, the 2021 outbreak ended just four months after it began. Only 23 people contracted Ebola; only 12 died. That's less than 1% of the deaths in the prior outbreak. The 2021 outbreak cost  $100 million to control— which sounds like a lot but pales in comparison to the global economic cost of the previous outbreak: $53 billion. So should every country just copy Guinea’s approach? Not exactly. It is always important to respond to an outbreak quickly, so an early warning system is essential. But beyond that, a successful response can look very different for different diseases  in different countries. For example, Brazil quenched an outbreak of yellow fever, which is spread by mosquitoes, primarily by mounting a massive vaccination campaign. That strategy worked well for Brazil because it’s one of the major global producers of the yellow fever vaccine, and its population was accustomed to regular, routine vaccinations. But for many diseases, you don't even need a mass vaccination program. In August of 2021, a truck driver tested positive for cholera in Burkina Faso. Health care workers alerted  the government that same day and contact tracing began immediately. Cholera is caused by a bacterium, so Burkina Faso gave antibiotics to those exposed or potentially exposed. This extremely fast response  stopped the outbreak just a few weeks after it started. Cholera often rears its head in West Africa— in 2021, there were over 100,000 cases and more than 3,700 deaths. Because Burkina Faso was so well prepared, they had zero deaths that year. Zero. In Chiang Mai, Thailand,  health officials piloted a community-owned, community-driven outbreak alert system to monitor animal health— that’s important because some animal outbreaks have the potential to spill over and become human outbreaks. Villagers used an app to alert health authorities about outbreaks in animals. Over the course of 16 months, 36 animal outbreaks were identified. For any outbreak response system to be effective, it needs to be trusted, valued, and ultimately used by communities. That means reaching people where they are, in the language they speak, and aware of the culture, beliefs, and practices with which they live. Perhaps most importantly, we can't expect to do nothing for years and then just swing into action when an outbreak occurs. One of the best ways to save lives is to invest in lasting health infrastructure, 365 days a year, for everyone, especially the most vulnerable among us.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I want to start with a story, a la Seth Godin, from when I was 12 years old. My uncle Ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater -- at least I thought it was beautiful. And it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach, and Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru were kind of right across the chest, that were also fuzzy. And I wore it whenever I could, thinking it was the most fabulous thing I owned. Until one day in ninth grade, when I was standing with a number of the football players. And my body had clearly changed, and Matt, who was undeniably my nemesis in high school, said in a booming voice that we no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips, but we could all ski on Mount Novogratz. (Laughter) And I was so humiliated and mortified that I immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her for ever letting me wear the hideous sweater. We drove to the Goodwill and we threw the sweater away somewhat ceremoniously, my idea being that I would never have to think about the sweater nor see it ever again. Fast forward -- 11 years later, I'm a 25-year-old kid. I'm working in Kigali, Rwanda, jogging through the steep slopes, when I see, 10 feet in front of me, a little boy -- 11 years old -- running toward me, wearing my sweater. And I'm thinking, no, this is not possible. But so, curious, I run up to the child -- of course scaring the living bejesus out of him -- grab him by the collar, turn it over, and there is my name written on the collar of this sweater. I tell that story, because it has served and continues to serve as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness that we all have on this Earth. We so often don't realize what our action and our inaction does to people we think we will never see and never know. I also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story of what aid is and can be. That this traveled into the Goodwill in Virginia, and moved its way into the larger industry, which at that point was giving millions of tons of secondhand clothing to Africa and Asia. Which was a very good thing, providing low cost clothing. And at the same time, certainly in Rwanda, it destroyed the local retailing industry. Not to say that it shouldn't have, but that we have to get better at answering the questions that need to be considered when we think about consequences and responses. So, I'm going to stick in Rwanda, circa 1985, 1986, where I was doing two things. I had started a bakery with 20 unwed mothers. We were called the 'Bad News Bears,' and our notion was we were going to corner the snack food business in Kigali, which was not hard because there were no snacks before us. And because we had a good business model, we actually did it, and I watched these women transform on a micro-level. But at the same time, I started a micro-finance bank, and tomorrow Iqbal Quadir is going to talk about Grameen, which is the grandfather of all micro-finance banks, which now is a worldwide movement -- you talk about a meme -- but then it was quite new, especially in an economy that was moving from barter into trade. We got a lot of things right. We focused on a business model; we insisted on skin in the game. The women made their own decisions at the end of the day as to how they would use this access to credit to build their little businesses, earn more income so they could take care of their families better. What we didn't understand, what was happening all around us, with the confluence of fear, ethnic strife and certainly an aid game, if you will, that was playing into this invisible but certainly palpable movement inside Rwanda, that at that time, 30 percent of the budget was all foreign aid. The genocide happened in 1994, seven years after these women all worked together to build this dream. And the good news was that the institution, the banking institution, lasted. In fact, it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country. The bakery was completely wiped out, but the lessons for me were that accountability counts -- got to build things with people on the ground, using business models where, as Steven Levitt would say, the incentives matter. Understand, however complex we may be, incentives matter. So when Chris raised to me how wonderful everything that was happening in the world, that we were seeing a shift in zeitgeist, on the one hand I absolutely agree with him, and I was so thrilled to see what happened with the G8 -- that the world, because of people like Tony Blair and Bono and Bob Geldof -- the world is talking about global poverty; the world is talking about Africa in ways I have never seen in my life. It's thrilling. And at the same time, what keeps me up at night is a fear that we'll look at the victories of the G8 -- 50 billion dollars in increased aid to Africa, 40 billion in reduced debt -- as the victory, as more than chapter one, as our moral absolution. And in fact, what we need to do is see that as chapter one, celebrate it, close it, and recognize that we need a chapter two that is all about execution, all about the how-to. And if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today, it's that the only way to end poverty, to make it history, is to build viable systems on the ground that deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor, in ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable. If we do that, we really can make poverty history. And it was that -- that whole philosophy -- that encouraged me to start my current endeavor called 'Acumen Fund,' which is trying to build some mini-blueprints for how we might do that in water, health and housing in Pakistan, India, Kenya, Tanzania and Egypt. And I want to talk a little bit about that, and some of the examples, so you can see what it is that we're doing. But before I do this -- and this is another one of my pet peeves -- I want to talk a little bit about who the poor are. Because we too often talk about them as these strong, huge masses of people yearning to be free, when in fact, it's quite an amazing story. On a macro level, four billion people on Earth make less than four dollars a day. That's who we talk about when we think about 'the poor.' If you aggregate it, it's the third largest economy on Earth, and yet most of these people go invisible. Where we typically work, there's people making between one and three dollars a day. Who are these people? They are farmers and factory workers. They work in government offices. They're drivers. They are domestics. They typically pay for critical goods and services like water, like healthcare, like housing, and they pay 30 to 40 times what their middleclass counterparts pay -- certainly where we work in Karachi and Nairobi. The poor also are willing to make, and do make, smart decisions, if you give them that opportunity. So, two examples. One is in India, where there are 240 million farmers, most of whom make less than two dollars a day. Where we work in Aurangabad, the land is extraordinarily parched. You see people on average making 60 cents to a dollar. This guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named Ami Tabar. What he did was see what was happening in Israel, larger approaches, and figure out how to do a drip irrigation, which is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock. But previously it's only been created for large-scale farms, so Ami Tabar took this and modularized it down to an eighth of an acre. A couple of principles: build small. Make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor. This family, Sarita and her husband, bought a 15-dollar unit when they were living in a -- literally a three-walled lean-to with a corrugated iron roof. After one harvest, they had increased their income enough to buy a second system to do their full quarter-acre. A couple of years later, I meet them. They now make four dollars a day, which is pretty much middle class for India, and they showed me the concrete foundation they had just laid to build their house. And I swear, you could see the future in that woman's eyes. Something I truly believe. You can't talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets, and I again give Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard huge kudos for bringing to the world this notion of his rage -- for five dollars you can save a life. Malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year. 300 to 500 million cases are reported. It's estimated that Africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year to the disease. Five dollars can save a life. We can send people to the moon; we can see if there's life on Mars -- why can't we get five-dollar nets to 500 million people? The question, though, is not 'Why can't we?' The question is how can we help Africans do this for themselves? A lot of hurdles. One: production is too low. Two: price is too high. Three: this is a good road in -- right near where our factory is located. Distribution is a nightmare, but not impossible. We started by making a 350,000-dollar loan to the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in Africa so that they could transfer technology from Japan and build these long-lasting, five-year nets. Here are just some pictures of the factory. Today, three years later, the company has employed another thousand women. It contributes about 600,000 dollars in wages to the economy of Tanzania. It's the largest company in Tanzania. The throughput rate right now is 1.5 million nets, three million by the end of the year. We hope to have seven million at the end of next year. So the production side is working. On the distribution side, though, as a world, we have a lot of work to do. Right now, 95 percent of these nets are being bought by the U.N., and then given primarily to people around Africa. We're looking at building on some of the most precious resources of Africa: people. Their women. And so I want you to meet Jacqueline, my namesake, 21 years old. If she were born anywhere else but Tanzania, I'm telling you, she could run Wall Street. She runs two of the lines, and has already saved enough money to put a down payment on her house. She makes about two dollars a day, is creating an education fund, and told me she is not marrying nor having children until these things are completed. And so, when I told her about our idea -- that maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States, and find a way for the women themselves to go out and sell these nets to others -- she quickly started calculating what she herself could make and signed up. We took a lesson from IDEO, one of our favorite companies, and quickly did a prototyping on this, and took Jacqueline into the area where she lives. She brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts together to see if she could sell these nets, five dollars apiece, despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one, and we learned a lot about how you sell things. Not coming in with our own notions, because she didn't even talk about malaria until the very end. First, she talked about comfort, status, beauty. These nets, she said, you put them on the floor, bugs leave your house. Children can sleep through the night; the house looks beautiful; you hang them in the window. And we've started making curtains, and not only is it beautiful, but people can see status -- that you care about your children. Only then did she talk about saving your children's lives. A lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell goods and services to the poor. I want to end just by saying that there's enormous opportunity to make poverty history. To do it right, we have to build business models that matter, that are scaleable and that work with Africans, Indians, people all over the developing world who fit in this category, to do it themselves. Because at the end of the day, it's about engagement. It's about understanding that people really don't want handouts, that they want to make their own decisions; they want to solve their own problems; and that by engaging with them, not only do we create much more dignity for them, but for us as well. And so I urge all of you to think next time as to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity that we all have -- to make poverty history -- by really becoming part of the process and moving away from an us-and-them world, and realizing that it's about all of us, and the kind of world that we, together, want to live in and share. Thank you. (Applause)\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       We've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising. So I'll try and do that, but I want to start with two things that everyone already knows. And the first one, in fact, is something that has been known for most of recorded history, and that is, that the planet Earth, or the solar system, or our environment or whatever, is uniquely suited to sustain our evolution -- or creation, as it used to be thought -- and our present existence, and most important, our future survival. Nowadays, this idea has a dramatic name: Spaceship Earth. And the idea there is that outside the spaceship, the universe is implacably hostile, and inside is all we have, all we depend on, and we only get the one chance: if we mess up our spaceship, we've got nowhere else to go. Now, the second thing that everyone already knows is that, contrary to what was believed for most of human history, human beings are not, in fact, the hub of existence. As Stephen Hawking famously said, we're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet that's in orbit around a typical star, which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy, and so on. Now, the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of saying that we're at a very untypical place, uniquely suited and so on. And the second one is saying that we're at a typical place. And, especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by and to inform your life decisions, then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other. But that doesn't prevent them from both being completely false. (Laughter) And they are. So let me start with the second one: typical. Well, is this a typical place? Well, let's look around, you know, look in a random direction, and we see a wall and chemical scum -- (Laughter) and that's not typical of the universe at all. All you've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction and look back, and you won't see any walls or chemical scum at all -- all you see is a blue planet. And if you go further than that, you'll see the Sun, the solar system and the stars and so on, but that's still not typical of the universe, because stars come in galaxies. And most places in the universe, a typical place in the universe, is nowhere near any galaxies. So let's go out further, till we're outside the galaxy, and look back, and yeah, there's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us. And at this point, we've come 100,000 light-years from here. But we're still nowhere near a typical place in the universe. To get to a typical place, you've got to go 1,000 times as far as that, into intergalactic space. And so, what does that look like -- 'typical?' What does a 'typical' place in the universe look like? Well, at enormous expense, TED has arranged a high-resolution immersion virtual reality rendering of the view from intergalactic space. Can we have the lights off, please, so we can see it? Well, not quite, not quite perfect. You see, intergalactic space is completely dark, pitch dark. It's so dark, that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you, and that star were to explode as a supernova, and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you, you still wouldn't be able to see even a glimmer. That's how big and how dark the universe is. And that's despite the fact that a supernova is so bright, so brilliant an event, that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light-years. (Laughter) And yet, from intergalactic space, it's so far away you wouldn't even see it. It's also very cold out there -- less than three degrees above absolute zero. And it's very empty. The vacuum there is one million times less dense than the highest vacuum that our best technology on Earth can currently create. So that's how different a typical place is from this place. And that is how untypical this place is. So can we have the lights back on please? Thank you. Now, how do we know about an environment that's so far away and so different and so alien from anything we're used to? Well, the Earth -- our environment, in the form of us -- is creating knowledge. Well, what does that mean? Well, look out even further than we've just been -- I mean from here, with a telescope -- and you'll see things that look like stars, they're called quasars. 'Quasars' originally meant 'quasi-stellar object,' which means 'things that look a bit like stars.' (Laughter) But they're not stars. And we know what they are. Billions of years ago and billions of light-years away, the material at the center of a galaxy collapsed towards a supermassive black hole. And then intense magnetic fields directed some of the energy of that gravitational collapse and some of the matter back out in the form of tremendous jets, which illuminated lobes with the brilliance of -- I think it's a trillion -- suns. Now, the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlike the physics of such a jet. We couldn't survive for an instant in it. Language breaks down when trying to describe what it would be like in one of those jets. It would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion, but at point-blank range and for millions of years at a time. (Laughter) And yet, that jet happened in precisely such a way that billions of years later, on the other side of the universe, some bit of chemical scum could accurately describe and model and predict and explain, above all -- there's your reference -- what was happening there, in reality. The one physical system, the brain, contains an accurate working model of the other, the quasar. Not just a superficial image of it, though it contains that as well, but an explanatory model, embodying the same mathematical relationships and the same causal structure. Now, that is knowledge. And if that weren't amazing enough, the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time. That is the growth of knowledge. So, the laws of physics have this special property, that physical objects as unlike each other as they could possibly be can, nevertheless, embody the same mathematical and causal structure and to do it more and more so over time. So we are a chemical scum that is different. This chemical scum has universality. Its structure contains, with ever-increasing precision, the structure of everything. This place, and not other places in the universe, is a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essence of the whole of the rest of physical reality. And so, far from being insignificant, the fact that the laws of physics allow this or even mandate that this can happen is one of the most important things about the physical world. Now, how does the solar system -- our environment, in the form of us -- acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe? Well, one thing that's true about Stephen Hawking's remark -- I mean, it is true, but it's the wrong emphasis -- one thing that's true about it is that it doesn't do it with any special physics, there's no special dispensation, no miracles involved. It does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance. One of them is matter, because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing. Information processing is computation, computation requires a computer, and there's no known way of making a computer without matter. We also need energy to make the computer, and most important, to make the media, in effect, onto which we record the knowledge that we discover. And then thirdly, less tangible but just as essential for the open-ended creation of knowledge, of explanations, is evidence. Now, our environment is inundated with evidence. We happened to get round to testing, let's say, Newton's law of gravity, about 300 years ago. But the evidence that we used to do that was falling down on every square meter of the Earth for billions of years before that, and we'll continue to fall for billions of years afterwards. And the same is true for all the other sciences. As far as we know, evidence to discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciences is here just for the taking, on our planet. Our location is saturated with evidence and also with matter and energy. Out in intergalactic space, those three prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge are at their lowest possible supply -- as I said, it's empty, it's cold and it's dark out there. Or is it? Now actually, that's just another parochial misconception. (Laughter) Because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space, the same size as our home, the solar system. Now, that cube is very empty by human standards, but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter. And a million tons is enough to make, say, a self-contained space station, on which there's a colony of scientists that are devoted to creating an open-ended stream of knowledge, and so on. Now, it's way beyond present technology to even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic space and form it into other elements and so on. But the thing is, in a comprehensible universe, if something isn't forbidden by the laws of physics, then what could possibly prevent us from doing it, other than knowing how? In other words, it's a matter of knowledge, not resources. If we could do that, we'd automatically have an energy supply, because this transmutation would be a fusion reactor. And evidence? Well, again, it's dark out there to human senses, but all you've got to do is take a telescope, even one of present-day design, look out, and you'll see the same galaxies as we do from here. And with a more powerful telescope, you'll be able to see stars and planets in those galaxies, you'll be able to do astrophysics and learn the laws of physics. And locally there, you could build particle accelerators and learn elementary particle physics and chemistry, and so on. Probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips -- (Laughter) because it would take several hundred million years to get to the nearest life-bearing planet and back. But I have to tell you -- and sorry, Richard -- but I never did like biology field trips much -- (Laughter) and I think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years. (Laughter) So, in fact, intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge. Any such cube anywhere in the universe could become the same kind of hub that we are, if the knowledge of how to do so were present there. So, we're not in a uniquely hospitable place. If intergalactic space is capable of creating an open-ended stream of explanations, then so is almost every other environment, so is the Earth. So is a polluted Earth. And the limiting factor, there and here, is not resources -- because they're plentiful -- but knowledge, which is scarce. Now, this cosmic knowledge-based view may -- and, I think, ought to -- make us feel very special. But it should also make us feel vulnerable, because it means that without the specific knowledge that's needed to survive the ongoing challenges of the universe, we won't survive them. All it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light-years away, and we'll all be dead! Martin Rees has recently written a book about our vulnerability to all sorts of things, from astrophysics, to scientific experiments gone wrong, and most importantly, to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction. And he thinks that civilization has only a 50 percent chance of surviving this century. I think he's going to talk about that later in the conference. Now, I don't think that probability is the right category to discuss this issue in, but I do agree with him about this: we can survive and we can fail to survive. But it depends, not on chance, but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time. The danger is not at all unprecedented. Species go extinct all the time. Civilizations end. The overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations that have ever existed are now history. And if we want to be the exception to that, then logically, our only hope is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species and civilization from all the others, namely, our special relationship with the laws of physics, our ability to create new explanations, new knowledge -- to be a hub of existence. So let me now apply this to a current controversy, not because I want to advocate any particular solution, but just to illustrate the kind of thing I mean. And the controversy is global warming. Now, I'm a physicist, but I'm not the right kind of physicist. In regard to global warming, I'm just a layman. And the rational thing for a layman to do is to take seriously the prevailing scientific theory. And according to that theory, it's already too late to avoid a disaster, because, if it's true that our best option at the moment is to prevent CO2 emissions with something like the Kyoto Protocol, with its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars, or whatever it is, then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure. And the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem, merely to postpone it by a little. So it's already too late to avoid it, and it probably has been too late to avoid it ever since before anyone realized the danger. It was probably already too late in the 1970s, when the best available scientific theory was telling us that industrial emissions were about to precipitate a new ice age, in which billions would die. Now, the lesson of that seems clear to me, and I don't know why it isn't informing public debate. It is that we can't always know. When we know of an impending disaster and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself, then there's not going to be much argument, really. But no precautions and no precautionary principle can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee. Hence, we need a stance of problem-fixing, not just problem-avoidance. And it's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure, but that's only if we know what to prevent. If you've been punched on the nose, then the science of medicine does not consist of teaching you how to avoid punches. (Laughter) If medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only, then it would achieve very little of either. The world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs. It ought to be buzzing with plans to reduce the temperature and with plans to live at the higher temperature -- and not at all costs, but efficiently and cheaply. And some such plans exist, things like swarms of mirrors in space to deflect the sunlight away and encouraging aquatic organisms to eat more carbon dioxide. At the moment, these things are fringe research; they're not central to the human effort to face this problem or problems in general. And with problems that we are not aware of yet, the ability to put right -- not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely -- is our only hope, not just of solving problems, but of survival. So, take two stone tablets and carve on them. On one of them, carve: 'Problems are soluble.' And on the other one, carve: 'Problems are inevitable.' Thank you. (Applause)\n",
       "5982    Charles Van Doren, who was later a senior editor of Britannica, said the ideal encyclopedia should be radical -- it should stop being safe. But if you know anything about the history of Britannica since 1962, it was anything but radical: still a very completely safe, stodgy type of encyclopedia. Wikipedia, on the other hand, begins with a very radical idea, and that's for all of us to imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. And that's what we're doing. So Wikipedia -- you just saw the little demonstration of it -- it's a freely licensed encyclopedia. It's written by thousands of volunteers all over the world in many, many languages. It's written using wiki software -- which is the type of software he just demonstrated -- so anyone can quickly edit and save, and it goes live on the Internet immediately. And everything about Wikipedia is managed by virtually an all-volunteer staff. So when Yochai is talking about new methods of organization, he's exactly describing Wikipedia. And what I'm going to do today is tell you a little bit more about how it really works on the inside. So Wikipedia's owned by the Wikimedia Foundation, which I founded, a nonprofit organization. And our goal, the core aim of the Wikimedia Foundation, is to get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet. And so, if you think about what that means, it means a lot more than just building a cool website. We're really interested in all the issues of the digital divide, poverty worldwide, empowering people everywhere to have the information that they need to make good decisions. And so we're going to have to do a lot of work that goes beyond just the Internet. And so that's a big part of why we've chosen the free licensing model, because that empowers local entrepreneurs or anyone who wants to -- they can take our content and do anything they like with it -- you can copy it, redistribute it -- and you can do it commercially or non-commercially. So there's a lot of opportunities that are going to arise around Wikipedia all over the world. We're funded by donations from the public, and one of the more interesting things about that is how little money it actually takes to run Wikipedia. So Yochai showed you the graph of what the cost of a printing press was. And I'm going to tell you what the cost of Wikipedia is. But first, I'll show you how big it is. So we've got over 600,000 articles in English. We've got two million total articles across many, many different languages. The biggest languages are German, Japanese, French -- all the Western-European languages are quite big. But only around one-third of all of our traffic to our web clusters to the English Wikipedia, which is surprising to a lot of people. A lot of people think in a very English-centric way on the Internet, but for us, we're truly global. We're in many, many languages. How popular we've gotten to be -- we're a top-50 website and we're more popular than the New York Times. So this is where we get to Yochai's discussion. This shows the growth of Wikipedia -- we're the blue line there -- and this is the New York Times over there. And what's interesting about this is the New York Times website is a huge, enormous corporate operation with I have no idea how many hundreds of employees. We have exactly one employee, and that employee is our lead software developer. And he's only been our employee since January 2005, all the other growth before that ... So the servers are managed by a ragtag band of volunteers. All the editing is done by volunteers. And the way that we're organized is not like any traditional organization you can imagine. People are always asking, 'Well, who's in charge of this?' or 'Who does that?' And the answer is: anybody who wants to pitch in. It's a very unusual and chaotic thing. We've got over 90 servers now in three locations. These are managed by volunteer system administrators who are online. I can go online any time of the day or night and see eight to 10 people waiting for me to ask a question or something, anything about the servers. You could never afford to do this in a company. You could never afford to have a standby crew of people 24 hours a day and do what we're doing at Wikipedia. So we're doing around 1.4 billion page views monthly, so it's really gotten to be a huge thing. And everything is managed by the volunteers. And the total monthly cost for our bandwidth is about 5,000 dollars. And that's essentially our main cost. We could actually do without the employee. We hired Brian because he was working part-time for two years and full-time at Wikipedia, so we actually hired him, so he could get a life and go to the movies sometimes. So the big question when you've got this really chaotic organization is, why isn't it all rubbish? Why is the website as good as it is? First of all, how good is it? Well, it's pretty good. It isn't perfect, but it's much better than you would expect, given our completely chaotic model. So when you saw him make a ridiculous edit to the page about me, you think, 'Oh, this is obviously just going to degenerate into rubbish.' But when we've seen quality tests -- and there haven't been enough of these yet and I'm really encouraging people to do more, comparing Wikipedia to traditional things -- we win hands down. So a German magazine compared German Wikipedia, which is much, much smaller than English, to Microsoft Encarta and to Brockhaus multimedial, and we won across the board. They hired experts to come and look at articles and compare the quality, and we were very pleased with that result. So a lot of people have heard about the Wikipedia Bush-Kerry controversy. The media has covered this somewhat extensively. It started out with an article in Red Herring. The reporters called me up and they -- I mean, I have to say they spelled my name right, but they really wanted to say the Bush-Kerry election is so contentious, it's tearing apart the Wikipedia community. And so they quote me as saying, 'They're the most contentious in the history of Wikipedia.' What I actually said is they're not contentious at all. So it's a slight misquote. (Laughter) The articles were edited quite heavily. And it is true that we did have to lock the articles on a couple of occasions. Time magazine recently reported that 'Extreme action sometimes has to be taken, and Wales locked the entries on Kerry and Bush for most of 2004.' This came after I told the reporter that we had to lock it for -- occasionally a little bit here and there. So the truth in general is that the kinds of controversies that you would probably think we have within the Wikipedia community are not really controversies at all. Articles on controversial topics are edited a lot, but they don't cause much controversy within the community. And the reason for this is that most people understand the need for neutrality. The real struggle is not between the right and the left -- that's where most people assume -- but it's between the party of the thoughtful and the party of the jerks. And no side of the political spectrum has a monopoly on either of those qualities. The actual truth about the specific Bush-Kerry incident is that the Bush-Kerry articles were locked less than one percent of the time in 2004, and it wasn't because they were contentious; it was just because there was routine vandalism -- which happens sometimes even on stage ... (Laughter) Sometimes even reporters have reported to me that they vandalized Wikipedia and were amazed that it was fixed so quickly. And I said -- you know, I always say, please don't do that. That's not a good thing. So how do we do this? How do we manage the quality control? How does it work? So there's a few elements, mostly social policies and some elements of the software. So the biggest and the most important thing is our neutral point of view policy. This is something that I set down, from the very beginning, as a core principle of the community that's completely not debatable. It's a social concept of cooperation, so we don't talk a lot about truth and objectivity. The reason for this is if we say we're only going to write the 'truth' about some topic, that doesn't do us a damn bit of good of figuring out what to write, because I don't agree with you about what's the truth. But we have this jargon term of neutrality, which has its own long history within the community, which basically says, any time there's a controversial issue, Wikipedia itself should not take a stand on the issue. We should merely report on what reputable parties have said about it. So this neutrality policy is really important for us because it empowers a community that is very diverse to come together and actually get some work done. So we have very diverse contributors in terms of political, religious, cultural backgrounds. By having this firm neutrality policy, which is non-negotiable from the beginning, we ensure that people can work together and that the entries don't become simply a war back and forth between the left and the right. If you engage in that type of behavior, you'll be asked to leave the community. So, real-time peer review. Every single change on the site goes to the 'Recent changes' page. So as soon as he made his change, it went to the 'Recent changes' page. That recent changes page was also fed into an IRC channel, which is an Internet chat channel that people are monitoring with various software tools. And people can get RSS feeds -- they can get email notifications of changes. And then users can set up their own personal watch list. So my page is on quite a few volunteers' watch lists, because it is sometimes vandalized. And therefore, what happens is someone will notice the change very quickly, and then they'll just simply revert the change. There's a 'new pages feed,' for example, so you can go to a certain page of Wikipedia and see every new page as it's created. This is really important because a lot of new pages are just garbage that has to be deleted, you know, 'ASDFASDF.' But also, that's some of the most interesting and fun things, some of the new articles. People will start an article on some interesting topic, other people will find that intriguing and jump in and help and make it much better. So we do have edits by anonymous users, which is one of the most controversial and intriguing things about Wikipedia. So, Chris was able to do his change -- he didn't have to log in or anything; he just went on the website and made a change. But it turns out that only about 18 percent of all the edits to the website are done by anonymous users. And that's a really important thing to understand: the vast majority of the edits that go on on the website are from a very close-knit community of maybe 600 to 1,000 people who are in constant communication. And we have over 40 IRC channels, 40 mailing lists. All these people know each other. They communicate. We have off-line meetings. These are the people who are doing the bulk of the site, and they are, in a sense, semi-professionals at what they're doing. The standards we set for ourselves are equal to or higher than professional standards of quality. We don't always meet those standards, but that's what we're striving for. And so that tight community is who really cares for the site, and these are some of the smartest people I've ever met. It's my job to say that, but it's actually true. The type of people who were drawn to writing an encyclopedia for fun tend to be pretty smart people. The tools and the software: there's lots of tools that allow us -- allow us, meaning the community -- to self-monitor and to monitor all the work. This is an example of a page history on 'flat Earth,' and you can see some changes that were made. What's nice about this page is you can immediately take a look at this and see, 'OK, I understand now.' When somebody goes and looks at -- they see that someone, an anonymous IP number, made an edit to my page. That sounds suspicious. Who is this person? Somebody looks at it -- they can immediately see highlighted in red all of the changes that took place -- to see, OK, well, these words have changed, things like this. So that's one tool that we can use to very quickly monitor the history of a page. Another thing that we do within the community is we leave everything very open-ended. Most of the social rules and the methods of work are left completely open-ended in the software. All of that stuff is just on Wiki pages. And so there's nothing in the software that enforces the rules. The example I've got up here is the Votes for Deletion page. So, I mentioned earlier, people type 'ASDFASDF' -- it needs to be deleted. Cases like that, the administrators just delete it. There's no reason to have a big argument about it. But you can imagine there's a lot of other areas where the question is, is this notable enough to go in an encyclopedia? Is the information verifiable? Is it a hoax? Is it true? Is it what? So we needed a social method for figuring out the answer to this. And so the method that arose organically within the community is the Votes For Deletion page. And in the particular example we have here, it's a film, 'Twisted Issues,' and the first person says, 'Now this is supposedly a film. It fails the Google test miserably.' The Google test is you look in Google and see if it's there, because if something's not even in Google, it probably doesn't exist at all. It's not a perfect rule, but it's a nice starting point for quick research. So somebody says, 'Delete it, please. Delete it -- it's not notable.' And then somebody says, 'Wait, I found it. I found it in a book, 'Film Threat Video Guide: the 20 Underground Films You Must See.'' So the next persons says, 'Clean it up.' Somebody says, 'I've found it on IMDB. Keep, keep, keep.' And what's interesting about this is that the software is -- these votes are just text typed into a page. This is not really a vote so much as it is a dialogue. Now it is true that at the end of the day, an administrator can go through here and take a look at this and say, 'OK, 18 deletes, two keeps: we'll delete it.' But in other cases, this could be 18 deletes and two keeps, and we would keep it, because if those last two keeps say, 'Wait a minute. Nobody else saw this but I found it in a book, and I found a link to a page that describes it, and I'm going to clean it up tomorrow, so please don't delete it,' then it would survive. And it also matters who the people are who are voting. Like I say, it's a tight-knit community. Down here at the bottom, 'Keep, real movie,' RickK. RickK is a very famous Wikipedian who does an enormous amount of work with vandalism, hoaxes and votes for deletion. His voice carries a lot of weight within the community because he knows what he's doing. So how is all this governed? People really want to know about administrators, things like that. So the Wikipedia governance model, the governance of the community, is a very confusing, but workable mix of consensus -- meaning we try not to vote on the content of articles, because the majority view is not necessarily neutral -- some amount of democracy -- all of the administrators -- these are the people who have the ability to delete pages. That doesn't mean that they have the right to delete pages. They still have to follow all the rules -- but they're elected by the community. Sometimes people -- random trolls on the Internet -- like to accuse me of handpicking the administrators to bias the content of the encyclopedia. I always laugh at this, because I have no idea how they're elected, actually. There's a certain amount of aristocracy. You got a hint of that when I mentioned, like, RickK's voice would carry a lot more weight than someone we don't know. I give this talk sometimes with Angela, who was just re-elected to the board from the community -- to the Board of the Foundation, with more than twice the votes of the person who didn't make it. And I always embarrass her because I say, 'Well, Angela, for example, could get away with doing absolutely anything within Wikipedia, because she's so admired and so powerful.' But the irony is, of course, that Angela can do this because she's the one person who you know would never, ever break any rules of Wikipedia. And I also like to say she's the only person who actually knows all the rules of Wikipedia, so ... And then there's monarchy, and that's my role on the community, so ... (Laughter) I was describing this in Berlin once, and the next day in the newspaper the headline said, 'I am the Queen of England.' (Laughter) And that's not exactly what I said, but -- (Laughter) the point is my role in the community -- Within the free software world, there's been a long-standing tradition of the 'benevolent dictator' model. So if you look at most of the major free software projects, they have one single person in charge who everyone agrees is the benevolent dictator. Well, I don't like the term 'benevolent dictator,' and I don't think that it's my job or my role in the world of ideas to be the dictator of the future of all human knowledge compiled by the world. It just isn't appropriate. But there is a need still for a certain amount of monarchy, a certain amount of -- sometimes we have to make a decision and we don't want to get bogged down too heavily in formal decision-making processes. So as an example of how this can be important: we recently had a situation where a neo-Nazi website discovered Wikipedia, and they said, 'Oh, well, this is horrible, this Jewish conspiracy of a website, and we're going to get certain articles deleted that we don't like. And we see they have a voting process, so we're going to send -- we have 40,000 members and we're going to send them over and they're all going to vote and get these pages deleted.' Well, they managed to get 18 people to show up. That's neo-Nazi math for you. They always think they've got 40,000 members when they've got 18. But they managed to get 18 people to come and vote in a fairly absurd way to delete a perfectly valid article. Of course, the vote ended up being about 85 to 18, so there was no real danger to our democratic processes. On the other hand, people said, 'But what are we going to do? I mean, this could happen. What if some group gets really seriously organized and comes in and wants to vote?' Then I said, 'Well, fuck it, we'll just change the rules.' That's my job in the community: to say we won't allow our openness and freedom to undermine the quality of the content. And so, as long as people trust me in my role, then that's a valid place for me. Of course, because of the free licensing, if I do a bad job, the volunteers are more than happy to take and leave -- I can't tell anyone what to do. So the final point here is that to understand how Wikipedia works, it's important to understand that our wiki model is the way we work, but we are not fanatical web anarchists. In fact, we're very flexible about the social methodology, because ultimately, the passion of the community is for the quality of the work, not necessarily for the process that we use to generate it. Thank you. (Applause) Ben Saunders: Yeah, hi, Ben Saunders. Jimmy, you mentioned impartiality being a key to Wikipedia's success. It strikes me that much of the textbooks that are used to educate our children are inherently biased. Have you found Wikipedia being used by teachers and how do you see Wikipedia changing education? Jimmy Wales: Yeah, so, a lot of teachers are beginning to use Wikipedia. There's a media storyline about Wikipedia, which I think is false. It builds on the storyline of bloggers versus newspapers. And the storyline is, there's this crazy thing, Wikipedia, but academics hate it and teachers hate it. And that turns out to not be true. The last time I got an email from a journalist saying, 'Why do academics hate Wikipedia?' I sent it from my Harvard email address because I was recently appointed a fellow there. And I said, 'Well, they don't all hate it.' (Laughter) But I think there's going to be huge impacts. And we actually have a project that I'm personally really excited about, which is the Wikibooks project, which is an effort to create textbooks in all the languages. And that's a much bigger project. It's going to take 20 years or so to come to fruition. But part of that is to fulfill our mission of giving an encyclopedia to every single person on the planet. We don't mean we're going to Spam them with AOL-style CDs. We mean we're going to give them a tool that they can use. And for a lot of people in the world, if I give you an encyclopedia that's written at a university level, it doesn't do you any good without a whole host of literacy materials to build you up to the point where you can actually use it. The Wikibooks project is an effort to do that. And I think that we're going to see -- it may not even come from us; there's all kinds of innovation going on. But freely licensed textbooks are the next big thing in education.\n",



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 In terms of invention, I'd like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite projects. I think it's one of the most exciting that I'm working on, but I think it's also the simplest. It's a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world. It addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet, the number one cause of death in children under five. Which is ...? Water-borne diseases? Diarrhea? Malnutrition? No. It's breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires -- acute respiratory infections caused by this. Can you believe that? I find this shocking and somewhat appalling. Can't we make cleaner burning cooking fuels? Can't we make better stoves? How is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year? I know Bill Joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes, so I'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes, which is charcoal. (Laughter) So this is a picture of rural Haiti. Haiti is now 98 percent deforested. You'll see scenes like this all over the island. It leads to all sorts of environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the nation. A couple years ago there was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths -- that's directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil. So the rains come -- they go down the rivers and the flooding happens. Now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this: people need to cook, and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it. It's not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage. They know perfectly well, but they have no other choice. Fossil fuels are not available, and solar energy doesn't cook the way that they like their food prepared. And so this is what they do. You'll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree, cut it down and make charcoal out of it. So not surprisingly, there's a lot of effort that's been done to look at alternative cooking fuels. About four years ago, I took a team of students down to Haiti and we worked with Peace Corps volunteers there. This is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked. And the idea was that you could take waste paper; you could compress it and make briquettes that could be used for fuel. But this device was very slow. So our engineering students went to work on it and with some very simple changes, they were able to triple the throughput of this device. So you could imagine they were very excited about it. And they took the briquettes back to MIT so that they could test them. And one of the things that they found was they didn't burn. So it was a little discouraging to the students. (Laughter) And in fact, if you look closely, right here you can see it says, 'US Peace Corps.' As it turns out, there actually wasn't any waste paper in this village. And while it was a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village, it was 800 kilometers away. And so we thought perhaps there might be a better way to come up with an alternative cooking fuel. What we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level. You see these all over Haiti as well. They're small-scale sugar mills. And the waste product from them after you extract the juice from the sugarcane is called 'bagasse.' It has no other use. It has no nutritional value, so they don't feed it to the animals. It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it. What we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with, something like charcoal. So over the next couple of years, students and I worked to develop a process. So you start with the bagasse, and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of a waste fifty five-gallon oil drum. After some time, after setting it on fire, you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln, and then you end up with this carbonized material here. However, you can't burn this. It's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking. So we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes. And conveniently, one of my students was from Ghana, and he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called 'kokonte,' which is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root. And so what we did was we looked, and we found that cassava is indeed grown in Haiti, under the name of 'manioc.' In fact, it's grown all over the world -- yucca, tapioca, manioc, cassava, it's all the same thing -- a very starchy root vegetable. And you can make a very thick, sticky porridge out of it, which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes. So we did this. We went down to Haiti. These are the graduates of the first Ecole de Charbon, or Charcoal Institute. And these -- (Laughter) That's right. So I'm actually an instructor at MIT as well as CIT. And these are the briquettes that we made. Now I'm going to take you to a different continent. This is India and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in India. It's cow dung. And more than in Haiti, this produces really smoky fires, and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel. Kids and women are especially affected by it, because they're the ones who are around the cooking fires. So we wanted to see if we could introduce this charcoal-making technology there. Well, unfortunately, they didn't have sugarcane and they didn't have cassava, but that didn't stop us. What we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass. And there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area. And what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure, which they used ordinarily for their fuel. And we did side-by-side tests, and here you can see the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung. And you can see that it's a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel. And in fact, it heats the water a lot more quickly. And so we were very happy, thus far. But one of the things that we found was when we did side-by-side comparisons with wood charcoal, it didn't burn as long. And the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking. So we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in Haiti. So we went back to MIT, we took out the Instron machine and we figured out what sort of forces you needed in order to compress a briquette to the level that you actually are getting improved performance out of it? And at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this, we also had community partners in Haiti working to develop the process, to improve it and make it more accessible to people in the villages there. And after some time, we developed a low-cost press that allows you to produce charcoal, which actually now burns not only -- actually, it burns longer, cleaner than wood charcoal. So now we're in a situation where we have a product, which is actually better than what you can buy in Haiti in the marketplace, which is a very wonderful place to be. In Haiti alone, about 30 million trees are cut down every year. There's a possibility of this being implemented and saving a good portion of those. In addition, the revenue generated from that charcoal is 260 million dollars. That's an awful lot for a country like Haiti -- with a population of eight million and an average income of less than 400 dollars. So this is where we're also moving ahead with our charcoal project. And one of the things that I think is also interesting, is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley who's been doing risk analysis. And he's looked at the problem of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal. And he's found that worldwide, you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel. That's remarkable, but up until now, there weren't ways to do it without cutting down trees. But now we have a way that's using an agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel. One of the really exciting things, though, is something that came out of the trip that I took to Ghana just last month. And I think it's the coolest thing, and it's even lower tech than what you just saw, if you can imagine such a thing. Here it is. So what is this? This is corncobs turned into charcoal. And the beauty of this is that you don't need to form briquettes -- it comes ready made. This is my $100 laptop, right here. And actually, like Nick, I brought samples. (Laughter) So we can pass these around. They're fully functional, field-tested, ready to roll out. (Laughter) And I think one of the things which is also remarkable about this technology, is that the technology transfer is so easy. Compared to the sugarcane charcoal, where we have to teach people how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step of cooking the binder, this comes pre-briquetted. And this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now, which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life. (Laughter) But once you see it, like you guys in the front row -- All right, yeah, OK. So anyway -- (Laughter) Here it is. And this is, I think, a perfect example of what Robert Wright was talking about in those non-zero-sum things. So not only do you have health benefits, you have environmental benefits. But this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits. People can make their own cooking fuel from waste products. They can generate income from this. They can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who aren't making their own. It's really rare that you don't have trade-offs between health and economics, or environment and economics. So this is a project that I just find extremely exciting and I'm really looking forward to see where it takes us. So when we talk about, now, the future we will create, one of the things that I think is necessary is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in. And now, I don't actually mean the world that we live in. I mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat. I mean the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand, and where, when you work 10 hours a day, you're still only earning 60 dollars in a month. I mean the world where women and children spend 40 billion hours a year fetching water. That's as if the entire workforce of the state of California worked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water. It's a place where, for example, if this were India, in this room, only three of us would have a car. If this were Afghanistan, only one person in this room would know how the use the Internet. If this were Zambia -- 300 of you would be farmers, 100 of you would have AIDS or HIV. And more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day. These are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for. These are the issues that we need to be training our engineers, our designers, our business people, our entrepreneurs to be facing. These are the solutions that we need to find. I have a few areas that I believe are especially important that we address. One of them is creating technologies to promote micro-finance and micro-enterprise, so that people who are living below the poverty line can find a way to move out -- and that they're not doing it using the same traditional basket making, poultry rearing, etc. But there are new technologies and new products that they can make on a small scale. The next thing I believe is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops. And we need to rethink our development strategies, so that we're not promoting educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers, but rather to stop being poor farmers. And we need to think about how we can do that effectively. We need to work with the people in these communities and give them the resources and the tools that they need to solve their own problems. That's the best way to do it. We shouldn't be doing it from outside. So we need to create this future, and we need to start doing it now. Thank you. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you, incredible. Stay here. Tell us -- just while we see if someone has a question -- just tell us about one of the other things that you've worked on. Amy Smith: Some of the other things we're working on are ways to do low-cost water quality testing, so that communities can maintain their own water systems, know when they're working, know when they treat them, etc. We're also looking at low-cost water-treatment systems. One of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability to be able to do that. CA: What's the bottleneck preventing this stuff getting from scale? Do you need to find entrepreneurs, or venture capitalists, or what do you need to take what you've got and get it to scale? AS: I think it's large numbers of people moving it forward. It's a difficult thing -- it's a marketplace which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income. So you can't use the same models that you use in the United States for making things move forward. And we're a pretty small staff, which is me. (Laughter) So, you know, I do what I can with the students. We have 30 students a year go out into the field and try to implement this and move it forward. The other thing is you have to do things with a long time frame, as, you know, you can't expect to get something done in a year or two years; you have to be looking five or 10 years ahead. But I think with the vision to do that, we can move forward.\n",

However, when we're not at TED, we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible, especially in large urban areas like New York City. And that's because most people with decision-making powers, in both the public and the private sector, really don't feel as though they're in danger. The reason why I'm here today, in part, is because of a dog -- an abandoned puppy I found back in the rain, back in 1998. She turned out to be a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated. When she came into my life, we were fighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront despite the fact that our small part of New York City already handled more than 40 percent of the entire city's commercial waste: a sewage treatment pelletizing plant, a sewage sludge plant, four power plants, the world's largest food-distribution center, as well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each week. The area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city. So when I was contacted by the Parks Department about a $10,000 seed-grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects, I thought they were really well-meaning, but a bit naive. I'd lived in this area all my life, and you could not get to the river, because of all the lovely facilities that I mentioned earlier. Then, while jogging with my dog one morning, she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump. There were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won't mention here, but she kept dragging me, and lo and behold, at the end of that lot was the river. I knew that this forgotten little street-end, abandoned like the dog that brought me there, was worth saving. And I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community-led revitalization of the new South Bronx. And just like my new dog, it was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined. We garnered much support along the way, and the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park that the South Bronx had had in more than 60 years. We leveraged that $10,000 seed grant more than 300 times, into a $3 million park. And in the fall, I'm going to exchange marriage vows with my beloved. (Audience whistles) Thank you very much. (Applause) That's him pressing my buttons back there, which he does all the time. (Laughter) (Applause) But those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mine. We feel the problems right now, and have for some time. Environmental justice, for those of you who may not be familiar with the term, goes something like this: no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other. Unfortunately, race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff, like parks and trees, and where one might find the bad stuff, like power plants and waste facilities. As a black person in America, I am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health. I am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility, which I do. These land-use decisions created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity, diabetes and asthma. Why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood? Our 27 percent obesity rate is high even for this country, and diabetes comes with it. One out of four South Bronx children has asthma. Our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national average. These impacts are coming everyone's way. And we all pay dearly for solid waste costs, health problems associated with pollution and more odiously, the cost of imprisoning our young black and Latino men, who possess untold amounts of untapped potential. Fifty percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line; 25 percent of us are unemployed. Low-income citizens often use emergency-room visits as primary care. This comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits. Poor people are not only still poor, they are still unhealthy. Fortunately, there are many people like me who are striving for solutions that won't compromise the lives of low-income communities of color in the short term, and won't destroy us all in the long term. None of us want that, and we all have that in common. So what else do we have in common? Well, first of all, we're all incredibly good-looking. (Laughter) Graduated high school, college, post-graduate degrees, traveled to interesting places, didn't have kids in your early teens, financially stable, never been imprisoned. OK. Good. (Laughter) But, besides being a black woman, I am different from most of you in some other ways. I watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down. My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam, only to be gunned down a few blocks from our home. Jesus. I grew up with a crack house across the street. Yeah, I'm a poor black child from the ghetto. These things make me different from you. But the things we have in common set me apart from most of the people in my community, and I am in between these two worlds with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other. So how did things get so different for us? In the late '40s, my dad -- a Pullman porter, son of a slave -- bought a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx, and a few years later, he married my mom. At the time, the community was a mostly white, working-class neighborhood. My dad was not alone. And as others like him pursued their own version of the American dream, white flight became common in the South Bronx and in many cities around the country. Red-lining was used by banks, wherein certain sections of the city, including ours, were deemed off-limits to any sort of investment. Many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions -- dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding. Hunts Point was formerly a walk-to-work community, but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to. A national highway construction boom was added to our problems. In New York State, Robert Moses spearheaded an aggressive highway-expansion campaign. One of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan. The South Bronx, which lies in between, did not stand a chance. Residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were razed. 600,000 people were displaced. The common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx. And if you are told from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come from your community, that it's bad and ugly, how could it not reflect on you? So now, my family's property was worthless, save for that it was our home, and all we had. And luckily for me, that home and the love inside of it, along with help from teachers, mentors and friends along the way, was enough. Now, why is this story important? Because from a planning perspective, economic degradation begets environmental degradation, which begets social degradation. The disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come. Antiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood. Are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided? What costs are associated with these decisions? And who pays? Who profits? Does anything justify what the local community goes through? This was 'planning' -- in quotes -- that did not have our best interests in mind. Once we realized that, we decided it was time to do our own planning. That small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of building a Greenway movement in the South Bronx. I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade with dedicated on-street bike paths. Physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety, the placement of the waste and other facilities, which, if done properly, don't compromise a community's quality of life. They provide opportunities to be more physically active, as well as local economic development. Think bike shops, juice stands. We secured 20 million dollars to build first-phase projects. This is Lafayette Avenue -- and that's redesigned by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects. And once this path is constructed, it'll connect the South Bronx with more than 400 acres of Randall's Island Park. Right now we're separated by about 25 feet of water, but this link will change that. As we nurture the natural environment, its abundance will give us back even more. We run a project called the Bronx [Environmental] Stewardship Training, which provides job training in the fields of ecological restoration, so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these well-paying jobs. Little by little, we're seeding the area with green-collar jobs -- and with people that have both a financial and personal stake in their environment. The Sheridan Expressway is an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era, built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it. Even during rush hour, it goes virtually unused. The community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway. We have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to re-envision how this 28 acres can be better utilized for parkland, affordable housing and local economic development. We also built New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices. Cool roofs are highly-reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat, and pass it on to the building or atmosphere. Green roofs are soil and living plants. Both can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat, contribute to urban 'heat island' effect and degrade under the sun, which we in turn breathe. Green roofs also retain up to 75 percent of rainfall, so they reduce a city's need to fund costly end-of-pipe solutions -- which, incidentally, are often located in environmental justice communities like mine. And they provide habitats for our little friends! [Butterfly] (Laughter) So cool! Anyway, the demonstration project is a springboard for our own green roof installation business, bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx. [Green is the new black ...] (Laughter) (Applause) I like that, too. Anyway, I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here, but since I have all of your attention: We need investors. End of pitch. It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission. Anyway -- (Laughter) (Applause) OK. Katrina. Prior to Katrina, the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward had a lot in common. Both were largely populated by poor people of color, both hotbeds of cultural innovation: think hip-hop and jazz. Both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another. In the post-Katrina era, we have still more in common. We're at best ignored, and maligned and abused, at worst, by negligent regulatory agencies, pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability. Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable. But we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out. We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone. Now will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two, like the South Bronx did? Or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation in communities like mine? Now listen, I do not expect individuals, corporations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moral. This presentation today only represents some of what I've been through. Like a tiny little bit. You've no clue. But I'll tell you later, if you want to know. (Laughter) But -- I know it's the bottom line, or one's perception of it, that motivates people in the end. I'm interested in what I like to call the 'triple bottom line' that sustainable development can produce. Developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned: the developers, government and the community where these projects go up. At present, that's not happening in New York City. And we are operating with a comprehensive urban-planning deficit. A parade of government subsidies is going to propose big-box and stadium developments in the South Bronx, but there is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic, pollution, solid waste and the impacts on open space. And their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame it's not even funny. Because on top of that, the world's richest sports team is replacing the House That Ruth Built by destroying two well-loved community parks. Now, we'll have even less than that stat I told you about earlier. And although less than 25 percent of South Bronx residents own cars, these projects include thousands of new parking spaces, yet zip in terms of mass public transit. Now, what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy, environmentally-challenged community, versus incorporating structural, sustainable changes. My agency is working closely with Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issues. Now let's get this straight: I am not anti-development. Ours is a city, not a wilderness preserve. And I've embraced my inner capitalist. And, but I don't have -- (Laughter) You probably all have, and if you haven't, you need to. (Laughter) So I don't have a problem with developers making money. There's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable, community-friendly development can still make a fortune. Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins -- both heroes of mine by the way -- have shown that you can actually do that. I do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit. That it continues is a shame upon us all, because we are all responsible for the future that we create. But one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities, is to learn from visionaries in other cities. This is my version of globalization. Let's take Bogota. Poor, Latino, surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking; a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx. However, this city was blessed in the late 1990s with a highly-influential mayor named Enrique Peñalosa. He looked at the demographics. Few Bogotanos own cars, yet a huge portion of the city's resources was dedicated to serving them. If you're a mayor, you can do something about that. His administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three, outlawed parking on those streets, expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes, created public plazas, created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems in the entire world. For his brilliant efforts, he was nearly impeached. But as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day-to-day lives, incredible things happened. People stopped littering. Crime rates dropped, because the streets were alive with people. His administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time, and on a third-world budget, at that. We have no excuse in this country, I'm sorry. But the bottom line is: their people-first agenda was not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars, but rather, to provide opportunities for all Bogotanos to participate in the city's resurgence. That development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical idea here in the U.S. But Bogota's example has the power to change that. You, however, are blessed with the gift of influence. That's why you're here and why you value the information we exchange. Use your influence in support of comprehensive, sustainable change everywhere. Don't just talk about it at TED. This is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to build, and as you all know, politics are personal. Help me make green the new black. Help me make sustainability sexy. Make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations. Help me fight for environmental and economic justice. Support investments with a triple-bottom-line return. Help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table, and insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere. Oh good, glad I have a little more time! Listen -- when I spoke to Mr. Gore the other day after breakfast, I asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included in his new marketing strategy. His response was a grant program. I don't think he understood that I wasn't asking for funding. I was making him an offer. (Applause) What troubled me was that this top-down approach is still around. Now, don't get me wrong, we need money. (Laughter) But grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision-making process. Of the 90 percent of the energy that Mr. Gore reminded us that we waste every day, don't add wasting our energy, intelligence and hard-earned experience to that count. (Applause) I have come from so far to meet you like this. Please don't waste me. By working together, we can become one of those small, rapidly-growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world. We might have come to this conference from very, very different stations in life, but believe me, we all share one incredibly powerful thing. We have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Ciao, bellos! (Applause)\n",

       "      <td>Hello, I am Machine Dazzle, and I am an emotionally-driven, instinct-based conceptual artist, designer and musician. Today I'm going to talk about the power of transformation through the sacred ritual of costume. With the help of my friend Matty Crosland. Matty? Oh, hey, girl. (Laughs) Matty is going to hand out a few seeds of possibility while I continue. Growing up in Middle America, I wasn't allowed to be who I was. I was discouraged from a career in the arts. When we went to the toy store, my two brothers would run to the black and blue aisle and I would run to the pink aisle. There was a lot of shame surrounding my preference for 'girls'' toys. I shoplifted my first Barbie. Desperate people do desperate things. But what was really happening during that time is I was building up a massive reserve of ideas, unrealized desires and dreams. And when I bought that one-way ticket to New York, which is the first decision I ever truly made for myself, I brought with me that reserve of unrealized dreams, desires and ideas. And that's when I really started to take risks. And I learned about the power of transformation, starting with becoming my true self. In 2019, I was commissioned by Guggenheim Works and Process to do a show. I knew immediately that I wanted to make a show about my mother, Deborah. Here she is, printed on my dress. It was the '60s, the bouffant, the cat-eye frames. Maybe some of you remember. Sadly, I lost my mother in 1996 to cancer. So in her honor, I created a rock and roll cabaret. It features songs that I wrote and sang about her, my relationship with her and my self-actualization. It is called 'Treasure,' and you can listen to it on your favorite streaming service. In fact, I just released the first dance track from it. It's called 'Understand,' and if you like to wiggle your peach, then you should look it up. (Laughter) My opening outfit, I created this big '60s bouffant. It is made out of about 2,500 metallic pipe cleaners. Why pipe cleaners? Because wigs are common. And I like to challenge existing systems and take risks. And it is actually quite heavy. Transformation takes commitment. Did I mention that my work is maximal? We are complex beings. We exist in many layers. Speaking of layers, then I added this swing coat. It's made out of an old American flag camouflaged in paint, dye and adorned with flowers. Flowers that I found in the dumpster at the cemetery where my mother's ashes are buried. Yes, people take fake flowers off of the graves, throw them into the dumpster to put new fake flowers on the graves. I thought it was appropriate. And so there it is, a source of protection. On stage, I became not my mother, that wasn't the point. I became a higher version of myself. Not man, not woman. Something other. In this show, I'm hoping to realize all of my dreams and not just mine, but all of my mother's, too, because she had them. More is more. One of my -- yes, I wish you could all have them, but you know how it is. (Laughter) Pom pom on head, look at that. One of my most maximal projects to date is with my favorite collaborator, Taylor Mac. Together with hundreds of others, we created a 24-hour show. It is called '24 Decades: A History of Popular Music.' It premiered in Brooklyn at St. Ann’s Warehouse in 2016. It's a 24-hour show. It starts in 1776 and goes to the present day. Every hour of the show is dedicated to a different decade in American history. For every decade, I created a costume that is conceptually adjacent, not historically accurate. Why? Because traditional historical costume already exists, conceptually and otherwise. And I like to break traditions and invent new ones. And when you break an egg, there are countless ways to turn it into something delicious. So it’s high noon in Brooklyn at St. Ann’s Warehouse. It's the top of the show in 1776, right after we freed ourselves from the British in the United States. And inspiration came when I was walking in Brooklyn, where I live. I was passing this laundromat. What were they doing? They were taking down these old, plastic, grand-opening flags. What were they doing? They were putting up new plastic, grand-opening flags. Well, I snatched them out of the garbage because, you know, and I noticed how weather-worn and brittle and fragile they were. And I got to thinking about the end of the American Revolution and how tattered and torn and broken everything must have been. And then it hit me. This costume wants to tell a story. An illegitimate child of colonialism ran away from home to New Orleans and opened the laundromat called Lou Washery, and they are celebrating the Grand Overture as the official, unofficial cheerleader of the original 13 colonies. This is maximalism. Not only is it layer upon layer aesthetically, it's idea on top of idea conceptually. It becomes its own story, almost that you can almost read like a book. Well, if history has taught us anything, it's that things change. Here we are an hour later in the show, and it's time for a costume change. An apple pie as a headdress. The care and the craft and the smell of home. And I put two pipes on Taylor's back, upholstered in a colonial fabric, steam was coming out of them at the top of that decade. But you know how it is. And they represent the invention of the steam engine, which gave way to westward expansion, for better or for worse. And then I thought, well, what else was happening? Well, George Washington was president at the time, and I was always kind of into his little cherry tree story of virtue. You know, 'I cannot tell a lie, I chopped down that cherry tree.' And it was the French Revolution across the pond and the guillotine was like, full on. So I was like, 'Well, why don't I combine them together?' And, oh, you know, severed heads in cherry tree drag as garment. What I'm getting at is, the costume can be so much more than the costume. It can be the props, it can be the set, it can tell its own stories, it can even be its own character. It can be all of it at the same time. This kind of maximalism leaves an audience completely satisfied, yet wanting more at the same time. More is more. Well, wouldn’t you know, now it’s 7pm at night, and it's time for the Civil War. I took two distinct inventions from this time to help tell this story. I read somewhere once that the American hot dog evolved out of German immigrants selling their bratwurst and rolls on the streets during the 1860s. Well, I like that. And then this distinctive barbed wire, you know, barbed wire, a symbol of separation, security, insecurity. Well, I wanted to combine the two together. In this way of making things, I bring order to disorder. By turning barbed wire into hot dogs, what I'm trying to do, hopefully, is eat through what is separating us, in this case, slavery. When you believe in something that is marginalized and goes against the mainstream of society, it is so important that you do it big, bold, brave and unapologetically, truly. OK, well, here we are after the war again. It’s time for Reconstruction. And, you know, how about the invention of the typewriter? I love the way this piece wiggles as Taylor clicks across the stage. And then the introduction of dynamite and toilet paper on rolls, how domestic! Well, I took those empty toilet paper rolls, and I painted them to look like sticks of dynamite and boom -- headdress, hello. You know, why not? Well, here we are. Now, we've been performing all night. We're tired. It’s 10am. It's the 1980s. Just in time for the AIDS pandemic. Taylor wears two white, high-heeled shoes sprinkled with little green pom poms. They look like clown shoes, but they represent the white blood cells being attacked by HIV. This collaboration, this '24-Decade History of Popular Music,' took maximalism and 'more is more' to a whole new level. I have to say, through the music, the storytelling and the transformative nature of the costumes, we changed the course of queer history. And if nothing else, it sure is fun to pull an all-nighter with 24 costume changes. Well, here we are. This is an image of me on the streets of New York City at the Easter Bonnet Parade several years ago. I am a fan of taking my art to the streets. But I have to tell you, it takes a little bit of courage to dress like this in public, particularly these days. Just about every part of my creative ethos is under attack in the United States right now. On first glance, you might see an over-the-top outfit on a Sunday, in black and white and pink. But upon closer inspection, you'll see the details, the skull peeking out, the skeletal hand creeping out of the innocent plush animals on my head. I once had my Easter bonnet ripped right off of my head in front of St. Patrick's Cathedral. Not this one. I don't think they would dare. Sometimes, I think that life is about overcoming all of your greatest fears. Life itself is how you go about that. I go all the way. I do the work. There is no happiness that I know unless I am risking something. The only true happiness that I know comes from this sense of accomplishment, by taking the risk. Well, here I am again on the streets of New York, this time for the Reclaim Pride March back in 2019 again. A good friend gave me really good advice once. 'Machine, it's never too early to be pre-revolutionary, and it's never too late to be post-apocalyptic chic.' (Laughter) Sometimes this course of action, this transformation, is the most honest action that you can take. You owe yourself honesty. I consider it a prayer. Today, after all, is a placeholder for what's coming tomorrow. By becoming other, you avoid labels. You can change someone's life just by walking across the room because you are changing what is possible in their minds. Be more. You will get more out of life. And not just for you, for everyone around you. I'm telling you, that is the Gospel truth. Another thing I wanted to say, this collective land of make-believe that we are in right now, this is very fertile, very creative space where anything is possible. Matty, let's bring it home. (Music: 'Miss Object of Desire' by Machine Dazzle) Mother, I want to be Miss Object of Desire A walking dream, a Phoenix lips of fire Strange reflection in the perfumed air Changing faces till she settles where a memory vibrates Liberation (Applause) (Music continues) Broken glass and my dress is torn Screaming in silence Thank you.

       "      <td>Can you paint with all the colors of the wind? I love this song from the first time I heard it. I was 14, growing up in public housing in western Sydney. So maybe a little too old for this Disney classic from 'Pocahontas.' But it spoke to me. I saw something of myself in it. At this stage, I think I knew I was queer. I mean, come on, I was rocking out to Disney. (Laughter) And look at those glasses. (Laughter) Seriously, what a queer kid. (Laughter) But I was also from a Pacific Indigenous heritage with conservative views and values. I didn't feel like I could fit into any of the boxes that were being presented to me. Straight, gay, Fijian, Australian. I couldn't pick just one color to paint with. Prior to colonization, sexuality amongst many of our Pacific islands across the region was fluid. Men would have sex with men without the stigma or shame afforded it today. Sexual intimacy was a way of being able to connect socially and relationally. Sex wasn't just for procreation. Or in marriage. It wasn't exclusively monogamous. Just because you had sex with a man didn't define your sexuality. It didn't make you an outcast. But as Europeans started to colonize the Pacific region, they brought Christian missionaries with them. They told us to cover up our beautiful bodies. We were taught shame. We were told to stop practicing Pacifica cultures and values that were seen as provocative. To a Western and white perspective, our non-binary sexuality was judged as tribal, outdated, sinful and impossible to practice alongside a Christian faith. Still today, those who are Indigenous to the Pacific are negatively impacted by whiteness. That “white is right, West is best.” I was brought up to espouse strong Christian beliefs, views and values which would shape my burgeoning identity as an adult. From these staunch conservative views, I was taught to fear the queer. Those people that were seen as unusual and fruity. And in essence, I grew to despise a part of myself. I sought to separate my queerness from my identity. I could never see myself as part of that world. Growing up, biracial and bisexual constantly challenged the way I saw the world around me. I was unsure about my thinking, feelings and behaviors around liking males and females. I was unsure about my thinking, feelings and behaviors when it came to whether I needed to be a white Australian or a Fijian person. And whether this needed to be framed within a binary to choose one over the other. In this way, I don't think that my story is unique. There's plenty of people in the queer world that have escaped conservative upbringings, religions and cultures. But this is only part of my story. Another common story in the queer community is the coming-out story. When did you tell your parents? How did they react? How it liberated you or ultimately separated you from your family. But this didn't feel like an option for me either. I believe that embedded in these particular stories, these tropes, is a part of dominant queer culture that made it very hard for me to access the queer world. For example, when I started to go to gay clubs, I would be lining up at the front of the club and often I would get door staff come up to me and go, 'Sorry, you do know this is a gay club, right?' From these lived experiences, I feel that there is a whiteness that pervades queer culture. And I didn't want to give up my identity and my appearance as a Pacific indigenous person to be queer. Pacifica cultures really, really value and esteem the collective above the individual. For Pacifica people, our families are inextricably connected to our own sense of self-agency, self-determination, self-esteem, self-love and self-worth. Our own individual identities are meshed and intertwined with our family's reputation and standing in the community. Our mind, body and souls are inextricably connected to the broader community, to our families, to ourselves and to others. I didn't want to come out to potentially ostracize myself, to make a point to separate myself from my Pacific and faith communities. I couldn't then see my authentic self in any of these spaces. And a quick shout out to my son on the left-hand side. Round of applause for my son. (Laughs) (Applause) He said to me this morning, 'Daddy, make sure you mention me.' So I was like, 'OK, son. Alright.' So there you go for the recording, son. And the rest are my other family, that's up there as well. Across queer cultures and the broader community, we have learned to embrace our gender and sexual differences. We encourage individuals to be allies for each other and to support safe spaces for those that are seen to not fit in. We empower and really encourage individuals to really develop and express their self-agency, their self-determination, their self love, their self-worth. We boldly go into spaces striving to bring others with us to ensure that we can create inclusive societies for everyone. However, the dominant Western view in queer cultures is still based on the individual. Me, myself and I. And my individual pursuits towards happiness. As a queer Indigenous Pacific person, I feel that there are parts of queer culture that is white, feels very white. We may fail to see the importance of bringing our families and our cultural communities along our journey as queer people. It's either the queer way or the highway. It's one or the other. Young or old. Rich or poor. Smart or stupid. Masculine or feminine. Fit or fat. These binaries create a sense of us and them, those people. A binary approach and position that we generally in Western white societies use to determine the norm. We create, conflate, perpetuate binaries that create divisions in our society. Saints or sinner, straight or gay. I see it like this. Binaries are a very white and Western way of thinking, feeling and behaving. As individuals today, we live within these binaries and create identities that then create these labels. We use these labels to then define and confine people and places. We are one or the other. But what we fail to see is that our identities are more than a set of binaries. Our own identities are comprised of intersecting identifiers that contributes to who you are, including our age, class, color, education, gender, size, spirituality, sexuality, and so, so much more. We need to decolonize queerness, to live beyond “white is right, West is best.” Because if we don't, we're going to continue to create silos and divisions in our societies that don't create inclusive and safe spaces for everyone. For Indigenous queer people, they shape our connection to community and culture, our families. If we don't include that within our understanding of who we are, even as queer people, then we're not able to be, again, our true and authentic selves. We're not able to then be our fabulous selves as part of the queer community. And it's really, really interesting because I believe that we can learn so much from pre-colonial cultures like those that were practiced in the Pacific, that provide a different way of looking at a society. A queer way that pre-dates all the privileges that go into binary ways of thinking, feeling and behaving. Across many of our Pacifica languages we have a lot of key concepts that help solidify and support a shared understanding of the collective. For example, in Fijian, 'solesolevaki' is all about reciprocal living, where my wellbeing is your wellbeing. I will actively seek to ensure that your well-being and every part of your life is catered for, knowing that you will do the same for me. We strive to enact “veiqaravi,” as tatted here on my hand, to serve others. We strive to also embed and embold and empower people to practice 'veirokovi,' respect for self and others where we are relationally driven, where that is so important to our spaces and places. My sense of ability to actually put this into practice, my ability to actually understand these Indigenous perspectives has greatly helped shape and reconcile my queer identity today. But what's really interesting is that it's not just queer communities that need to decolonize itself. It's all of us as a broader society that needs to be part of a shared conversation to decolonize, deconstruct and disrupt binary ways of thinking, feeling and behaving. So how can we practically do that? Practice cultural humility, where you are constantly learning and embracing differences, where you get over yourselves and strive to learn about other people's differences and how that can be meaningfully included in the way in which you create safe spaces for everyone. I also believe it's possible to bring Indigenous perspectives into Western and white workplaces. For example, I’ve introduced the concept of “talanoa” in all of my work meetings. Talanoa is all about being able to create a safe space where everyone is able to contribute to a collective, collegial and collaborative conversation. Where people are able to bring their authentic selves into these spaces. Literally, I will chair meetings where I have no firm set agenda items and I literally would just hold space for participants just to bring themselves. So you can tell I'm a social worker, right? (Laughter) Safe space, safe space, safe space. It's OK, it's OK. But it's through these safe spaces that people can bring their multiple, intersecting identifiers, including their age, their class, color, education, gender, size, spirituality, sexuality and so, so much more. I invite queer communities to come talanoa with Pacific Indigenous Communities to create robust and resilient queer cultures. I have been able to greatly reconcile my queer and Pacifica identities, which has now really been embraced to help shape how I see the world around me today. And it's through these shared perspectives and approaches that we can truly embrace cultural diversity and its differences. And to know that people can live beyond those binaries and those labels we continue to perpetuate and perpetrate against others. It is a commitment from queer communities to decolonize queerness. It's a commitment from me, from you and all of us to decolonize Western and white societies and to live beyond the binary way of thinking, feeling and behaving. I genuinely believe that it's through this common goal that we can truly learn how to paint with all the colors of the wind. “Vinaka vakalevu” and thank you.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I spent my whole career in the nonprofit sector. Street outreach, program management, fundraising, grant making, public policy, you name it, I've done it. I've seen a lot. And I'm a really positive person, so it's actually difficult to say this. But the way we do philanthropy right now, the way we've done it for decades, is broken. And here's how I found out. In my early 20s, I was a frontline social worker in New York City, working with people living with HIV. Many of them had multiple chronic illnesses, and they were underhoused. So I'd spend my days, and even some nights, with them, running around the city to doctor's appointments and housing agencies. The day-to-day work was hard. But the hardest part was we never had had enough funding to do the work. On Friday mornings, I'd go into the office to write up my case notes for the week and I'd speed past front reception, not looking at the mailboxes full of blue slips. Each blue letter marked another colleague let go because of our funding crisis. Within one month, I’d lost half my team, and my caseload ballooned from 30 to over 100. And this is the reality for so many nonprofits. They're at the mercy of their funders. And when we look at those funders, they decide who and what gets funded. And it's almost always a mystery how they make those decisions. Nonprofits spend so much time fundraising, filling out pages and pages and pages of paperwork. And they're filling out so much paperwork that they hardly have any time to actually support communities, which is literally the thing that they're funded to do. After years of doing amazing work, improving every single metric, we'd hear things like, 'I'm sorry, our major donor has switched direction. They’re no longer working and investing in HIV and AIDS.” Or, “I’m sorry, we issue grants for three years max.' This would never happen in the private sector. You do an amazing job for three years and then get fired? It makes no sense. So I decided to switch sides. Instead of being on the side that's asking for money, what if I went to the side that was giving money? Help them understand what was happening on the ground and make a change. So off I went into the world of philanthropy only to discover that trillions of dollars are in donor-advised funds and private foundations just waiting to be donated. Meanwhile, those nonprofits and community-led organizations are wasting so much time filling out paperwork and competing over scraps. I'd hear a donor publicly support a cause like homelessness. And then behind closed doors, I'd hear, 'They don't really know what's good for them. What they really need is ...' Which is code for “donor knows best.” I was confused. How could a donor possibly know what was really needed? Their lifestyle look nothing like the people they wanted to help. The problem wasn't a lack of money. Again, trillions of dollars are sitting just waiting to be put to work. But even if we unlocked every single one of those dollars, it actually wouldn't matter because a very small group of people are making all of the decisions about funding. Their priorities, their way. Almost 70 percent of donations are directed by the top one percent of donors. And they choose causes that resonate with their lives, like their university or the arts. And these issues are overfunded. And look, I know that donors have good intentions. I really do. But good intentions are not good enough. Communities are being left behind, and we are running out of time. I wanted to shift the power dynamic from a top-down approach to a community-led model, where nonprofits and donors really work together. So in 2020, I co-founded the Foundation for Black Communities with Liban Abokor, Djaka Blais-Amare and Joseph Smith, to do exactly that. We were inspired by a radically different type of philanthropy, Black philanthropy. It's the formal and informal giving that happens in Black communities around the world. In some cases, it's the kind of giving that you don't get a tax receipt for. And I learned this mostly in my family. We do almost everything together, including box hand. Box hand is an informal savings group, and in my family we have 13 members. So twice a month we all throw a hand, meaning we put 100 dollars into the pot and one person gets the entire thing, 1,300 dollars. The person who gets the full amount rotates, and you'll get the full thing two times a year. It's helped my family buy a new fridge, pay school tuition, and you know what, we've even put a down payment on a house using this. And sometimes we negotiate. 'Oh, you need your hand ahead of me? No problem, I'll wait.' Of the 13 people, some really need it. It's their only means of savings. And others would be fine without it. But here, we're all equal. There is no top or bottom. It's not about charity or pity or sympathy. The goal of box hand is that everybody levels up. And it’s easier to level up together because we're accountable to the collective. This practice has existed across the African diaspora since the 1700s. In Guyana, we call it box hand. In Nigeria, its “susu.” In Mali and Senegal it’s “tontines.” In Haiti, it’s called “sol.” And in Jamaica, it’s “partner.” And the cool thing is this exists outside of the African diaspora, too. It looks slightly different from place to place. The Haida nation has potlatches, in Mexico, there's 'tandas' and in Cambodia, there's 'tontine.' And communities turn to each other and use this kind of collective approach when we face exclusion and systemic racism in the financial industry. For example, Black people are rejected business loans and mortgages at twice the rate of the general population. And so when we face that exclusion, we turn to our communities and are creative in our solution-making. And, you know, this has been passed down from generation to generation. My mother taught me this. She gives generously to our communities because they gave generously to her. Now and forever, the collective giving never stops. Black philanthropy is rooted in a concept called Ubuntu. It's an African philosophy widely understood as humanity towards others. And we have a saying: “I am because you are.” Or 'I am because we are.' And that means, what affects you affects me. We're all interconnected and have a shared responsibility to one another. Ubuntu would be the guiding principle for the Foundation for Black Communities. And in order to do that, we need to make two practical shifts. Who is making funding decisions, and how those decisions are made? So the who is obvious. We're looking at Black community members, but we're looking for true, on-the-ground experts. And this is an important distinction. Some people will say to me, 'Rebecca, you're Black. Tell us what's best for Black communities,' which is actually ridiculous. How could I possibly speak on behalf of all Black people? You can't, it's not possible. So to have real insight, we’d look for local experts and let them make the decisions. Because they know their communities, their partners and field the best. And this is what we did in our recent, 500,000-dollar youth wellness granting program. We received 99 eligible applications from Black groups working in everything from diabetes awareness to inner-city farming and after school programming. And just like box hand, we turn to the collective and extended an invitation to be part of our grant review panel. Now, the invitation was intentionally put to anybody connected to the project. It might be a program manager, a participant or a volunteer. And those volunteers became peer reviewers. The peer reviewers read each application, scored them and offered candid feedback. And then we used their rankings to allocate funding. In other words, it was the collective that made the funding decision. Now, you might be thinking, 'What's the big deal about that?' But after years in philanthropy, I can tell you, that's not how it's typically done. It's usually the donor, maybe their relative or a CEO who has the final say. But here, we trusted community to do the work and to make those funding decisions. Luckily, we're not the first or only to pool funding and trust community to make decisions. We're part of a growing movement that's changing the power dynamics in philanthropy. And recently, because of our community-led approach and collective advocacy, the Canadian government awarded the Foundation for Black Communities a historic 200 million dollars. (Cheers and applause) This is amazing. And I'm hopeful that private foundations and donors will follow this powerful example. You know, there are hundreds of community-led collaboratives working in the most pressing issues of our times. For example, there’s Right Relations Collaborative, and Indigenous peoples are making the decisions there. At the Equality Fund, feminists are making the decisions. And at CLIMA Fund, climate activists are making the decisions. When I think back on my time in the front lines, I wonder, if different people were making the funding decisions would those blue slips even have existed? Because the funding was always available. It just wasn't accessible to the communities who need it most. And this is finally changing with community-led collaborative funds. Even after all of my time in the sector, the highs and lows, I'm optimistic, because the future of philanthropy is happening right now, where community-led collaboratives are the bridge between people who want to do good with their money and the people on the ground with the experience to do it. This is Ubuntu. We are all interconnected, and each of us has a role to play. I am because you are. I am because we are. Thank you. (Applause and cheers)</td>\n",

       "      <td>For 100 days in 1994, the African country of Rwanda suffered a horrific campaign of mass murder. Neighbor turned against neighbor as violence engulfed the region, resulting in the deaths of over one-tenth of the country’s population. The seeds of this conflict were planted a century earlier, first when German, and later Belgian, colonizers arrived in the country. At the time, Rwanda was ruled by a monarchy of Tutsi, one of the three ethnic groups comprising the population. Tutsi and the even smaller Twa communities were minority groups, while Hutu composed the majority. Many Hutus and Tutsi civilians were on good terms, but colonial powers encouraged political division. Belgians enforced record keeping around ethnic identity, and created a public narrative that cast Tutsi as elite rulers and Hutu as ordinary farmers. Over time, this propaganda led  to intense political hostility. And while colonial powers had largely withdrawn by 1959, lingering anger motivated a Hutu revolt, forcing many Tutsi leaders to flee the country. Over the following decade, Rwanda transitioned to an independent republic with a Hutu government. This new administration argued that as the majority group, Hutu deserved exclusive access to political power. They excluded the Tutsi minority  by appointing offices based on population and prohibited the return of Tutsi families that had fled years earlier. Hutu extremists also circulated propaganda blaming Tutsi for the country’s economic, social, and political problems. Discontent with their life in exile, a small group of Tutsi insurgents invaded Rwanda in 1990, beginning a violent civil war. The conflict lasted three years before it was resolved with a formal peace accord. But the war’s aftermath was rife with insecurity. While some civilians in both groups remained amicable, the treaty intensified political polarization. And in 1994, when a plane carrying the Hutu Rwandan president was shot down, the conflict broke out anew. This time, Hutu officials had prepared a deadly response to ensure they stayed in power. Working off a list of targets, government-funded Hutu militias flooded the streets, perpetrating acts of physical and sexual violence against Tutsi political enemies and civilians. Over the chaotic following months, over 1 million Hutu civilians joined their ranks due to coercion, self-preservation, or the pursuit of personal agendas. Tutsi victims sought refuge at churches and schools where they hoped international organizations would protect them, but no outside party came to their aid. UN soldiers who’d overseen the Peace Accord were instructed to abandon Tutsi civilians, and UN leadership refused to acknowledge the genocide taking place. The violence didn’t end until mid-July, when the Tutsi army— who instigated the previous civil war— seized control of the country. By the time the fighting was over, roughly 800,000 Rwandans had been killed, and only a small fraction of the Tutsi population was left alive. In the months that followed, there was no easy strategy for bringing the killers to justice. The UN established a special tribunal in Tanzania to try the key perpetrators. But Hutu civilians from every level of society had committed atrocities against their neighbors, friends, and even family members. There were roughly 120,000 Rwandans awaiting trial, and inmates were dying from overcrowding and poor hygiene. The new Rwandan government estimated  it would take 100 years to prosecute every accused civilian in national court. So officials determined  the best path forward involved looking to the country’s past. Rwanda has a traditional process for resolving interpersonal conflicts called gacaca. Roughly translating to “justice on the grass,” gacaca had long been used to address offenses within villages. Local witnesses would offer testimony and could then speak for or against the accused. Then, appointed lay judges would determine an appropriate penalty within the community’s means. In the hope of trying perpetrators more quickly, the government adapted gacaca for their formal courts. These hybrid trials had  no professional attorneys or judges, and no evidence outside the spoken word and a case file detailing the crimes of the accused. All charges were then divided into four categories: masterminding the genocide and committing acts of sexual violence, participating in the killings, physical assault, or destroying Tutsi property. Those found guilty of the first two categories were entered into the traditional court system, but the other crimes were assigned set penalties which could be reduced if the accused pled guilty. Beginning in 2002, thousands of gacaca courts convened every week. The process proved faster  than conventional courts, but Rwandan opinion on the trials was mixed. Some didn’t want to accuse their neighbors in a community setting, and many potential witnesses were intimidated to prevent their testimony. Additionally, while the trial showed that not all Hutu participated in the killings, the courts only reviewed cases with Tutsi victims, ignoring the Hutu casualties incurred during the genocide and the preceding civil war. When the trials concluded in 2012, the courts had convicted 1.7 million individuals. For some families, these verdicts  helped restore the dignity of those lost in the violence. For others, the trials were a decade-long reminder of a past they were desperate to leave behind.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I became obsessed with the relationship between the brain and the mind after suffering a series of concussions playing football and rugby in college. I felt my mind change for years after. I was studying computers at the time, and it felt as though I had damaged my hardware and that my software was running differently. Over the following years, a close friend suffered a serious neck injury and multiple friends and family members were struggling with crippling mental health issues. All around me, people that I loved dearly were being afflicted by ailments of the nervous system or the mind. I was grappling with all of this while pursuing an MFA in Design and Technology at Parsons when a friend and fellow student showed me an open-source tutorial on how to build a low-cost single-channel EEG system to detect brain activity. After a couple long nights of hacking and tinkering, I saw my brainwaves dancing across the screen for the very first time. And that moment changed my life. In that moment, I felt as though I had the possibility to help myself and the people I loved. And I also realized that I couldn't do it alone. I needed help. So in 2013, in Brooklyn, with some like-minded friends, I started OpenBCI, an open-source neurotechnology company. In the beginning, our goal was to build an inward-pointing telescope and to share the blueprints with the world so that anybody with a computer could begin peering into their own brain. At first, we were an EEG-only company. We sold brain sensors to measure brain activity. I thought that's what people wanted. But over time, we discovered people doing very strange things with our technology. Some people were connecting the equipment to the stomach to measure the neurons in the gut and study gut-brain connection and the microbiome. Others were using the tools to build new muscle sensors and controllers for prosthetics and robotics. And some were designing new devices and peripheral add-ons that could be connected to the platform to measure new types of data that I had never heard of before. What we learned from all of this is that the brain by itself is actually quite boring. Turns out brain data alone lacks context. And what we ultimately care about is not the brain, but the mind, consciousness, human cognition. When we have things like EMG sensors to measure muscle activity or ECG sensors to measure heart activity, eye trackers and even environmental sensors to measure the world around us, all of this makes the brain data much more useful. But the organs around our body, our sensory receptors, are actually much easier to collect data from than the brain, and also arguably much more important for determining the things that we actually care about: emotions, intentions and the mind overall. Additionally, we realized that people weren't just interested in reading from the brain and the body. They were also interested in modulating the mind through various types of sensory stimulation. Things like light, sound, haptics and electricity. It's one thing to record the mind, it's another to modulate it. The idea of a combined system that can both read from and write to the brain or body is referred to as a closed-loop system or bidirectional human interface. This concept is truly profound, and it will define the next major revolution in computing technology. When you have products that not just are designed for the average user but are designed to actually adapt to their user, that's something truly special. When we know what the data of an emotion or a feeling looks like and we know how to make that data go up or down, then using AI, we can build constructive or destructive interference patterns to either amplify or suppress those emotions or feelings. In the very near future, we will have computers that we are resonantly and subconsciously connected to, enabling empathetic computing for the very first time. In 2018, we put these learnings to work and began development of a new tool for cognitive exploration. Named after my friend Gael, who passed from ALS in 2016, we call it Galea. It’s a multimodal bio-sensing headset, and it is absolutely packed with sensors. It can measure the user’s heart, skin, muscles, eyes and brain, and it combines that capability with head-mounted displays or augmented and virtual reality headsets. Additionally, we're exploring the integration of non-invasive electrical neural stimulation as a feature. The Galea software suite can turn the raw sensor data into meaningful metrics. With some of the sensors, we're able to provide new forms of real-time interactivity and control. And with all of the sensors, we're able to make quantifiable inferences about high-level states of mind, things like stress, fatigue, cognitive workload and focus. In 2019, a legendary neurohacker by the name of Christian Bayerlein reached out to me. He was actually one of our very first Kickstarter backers when we got started, early on. Christian was a very smart, intelligent, happy-go-lucky and easygoing guy. And so I worked up the courage to ask him, 'Hey, Christian, can we connect you to our sensors?' At which point he said, 'I thought you would never ask.' (Laughter) So after 20 minutes, we had him rigged up to a bunch of electrodes, and we provided him with four new inputs to a computer. Little digital buttons, that he could control voluntarily. This essentially doubled his number of inputs to a computer. Years later, after many setbacks due to COVID, we flew to Germany to work with Christian in person to implement the first prototype of what we're going to be demoing here today. Christian then spent months training with that prototype and sending his data across the Atlantic to us in Brooklyn from Germany and flying a virtual drone in our offices. The first thing that we did was scour Christian's body for residual motor function. We then connected electrodes to the four muscles that he had the most voluntary control over, and then we turned those muscles into digital buttons. We then applied some smart filtering and signal processing to adapt those buttons into something more like a slider or a digital potentiometer. After that, we turned those four sliders and mapped them to a new virtual joystick. Christian then combined that new joystick with the joystick that he uses with his lip to control his wheelchair, and with the two joysticks combined, Christian finally had control over all the manual controls of a drone. I’m going to stop talking about it, and we’re going to show you. Christian, welcome. (Applause) At this point, I'm going to ask everybody to turn off your Bluetooth and put your phones in airplane mode so that you don't get hit in the face with a drone. (Laughter) How are you feeling, Christian? Christian Bayerlein: Yeah, let's do it. Conor Russomanno: Awesome. This is a heads-up display that's showing all of Christian's biometric data, as well as some information about the drone. On the left here, we can see Christian's muscle data. Christian is now going to attempt to fly the drone. How are you feeling, Christian, feeling good? CB: Yes. CR: All right. Rock and roll. Let's take this up for a joyride. Whenever you're ready. CB: I'm ready. (Applause and cheers) CR: All right, take her up. And now let's do something we probably shouldn't do and fly it over the audience. (Laughter) (Cheers and applause) Alright, actually, let’s do this. I'm going to ask for people to call out some commands in the audience. So how about you? Straight forward. Straight forward. (Laughter) Alright. How about you? Man: Up! (Laughter) CR: Not down. Oh, he's doing what he wants right now. Amazing. (Cheers and applause) Alright, let’s bring it back. And what I'm going to do right now is take control of the controller so that you guys know that there isn't someone backstage flying this drone. All right, Christian, you're alright with that? CB: Yeah. CR: Unplug. Forward. And we're going to land this guy now. CB: I think I was better than you. (Laughter) (Applause) CR: Amazing. (Applause) Now I'm going to unplug it so it doesn't turn on on its own. Perfect. Christian has repurposed dormant muscles from around his body for extended and augmented interactivity. We have turned those muscles into a generic controller that in this case we've mapped into a drone, but what's really cool is that joystick can be applied to anything. Another thing that's really cool is that even in individuals who are not living with motor disabilities, there exist dozens of dormant muscles around the body that we can tap into for augmented and expanded control interactivity. And lastly, all the code related to that virtual joystick, we're going to open source so that you can implement it and improve upon it. There's three things that have stood out to me from working on this project and many others over the years. One, we cannot conflate the brain with the mind. In order to understand emotions and tensions and the mind overall, we have to measure data from all over the body, not just the brain. Two, open-source technology access and literacy is one way that we can combat the potential ethical challenges we face in introducing neural technology to society. But that's not enough. We have to do much, much more than that. It's very important, imperative, that we set up guardrails and design the future that we want to live in. Three. It's the courage and resilience of trailblazers like Christian who don't get bogged down by what they can't do, but instead strive to prove that the impossible is in fact possible. (Applause) And since none of this would have been possible without you, Christian, the stage is yours. CB: Yeah, hi, everybody. Audience: Hi. CB: I'm excited to be here today. I was born with a genetic condition that affects my mobility and requires me to have assistance. Despite my disability, I'm a very happy and fulfilled person. What truly holds me back are not my physical limitations. It's rather the barriers in the environment. I'm a tech nerd and political activist. I believe that technology can empower disabled people. It can help create a better, more inclusive and accessible world for everyone. This demonstration is a perfect example. We saw what's possible when cutting edge technology is combined with human curiosity and creativity. So let's build tools that empower people, applications that break down barriers and systems that unlock a world of possibilities. I think that's an idea worth spreading. Thank you.

       "      <td>About 10 years ago, I took on the task to teach global development to Swedish undergraduate students. That was after having spent about 20 years, together with African institutions, studying hunger in Africa. So I was sort of expected to know a little about the world. And I started, in our medical university, Karolinska Institute, an undergraduate course called Global Health. But when you get that opportunity, you get a little nervous. I thought, these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in the Swedish college system, so I thought, maybe they know everything I'm going to teach them about. So I did a pretest when they came. And one of the questions from which I learned a lot was this one: 'Which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs?' And I put them together so that in each pair of countries, one has twice the child mortality of the other. And this means that it's much bigger, the difference, than the uncertainty of the data. I won't put you at a test here, but it's Turkey, which is highest there, Poland, Russia, Pakistan and South Africa. And these were the results of the Swedish students. I did it so I got the confidence interval, which is pretty narrow. And I got happy, of course -- a 1.8 right answer out of five possible. That means there was a place for a professor of international health and for my course. (Laughter) But one late night, when I was compiling the report, I really realized my discovery. I have shown that Swedish top students know, statistically, significantly less about the world than the chimpanzees. (Laughter) Because the chimpanzee would score half right if I gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey. They would be right half of the cases. But the students are not there. The problem for me was not ignorance; it was preconceived ideas. I did also an unethical study of the professors of the Karolinska Institute, which hands out the Nobel Prize in Medicine, and they are on par with the chimpanzee there. (Laughter) This is where I realized that there was really a need to communicate, because the data of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware. So we did this software, which displays it like this. Every bubble here is a country. This country over here is China. This is India. The size of the bubble is the population, and on this axis here, I put fertility rate. Because my students, what they said when they looked upon the world, and I asked them, 'What do you really think about the world?' Well, I first discovered that the textbook was Tintin, mainly. (Laughter) And they said, 'The world is still 'we' and 'them.' And 'we' is the Western world and 'them' is the Third World.' 'And what do you mean with 'Western world?'' I said. 'Well, that's long life and small family. And 'Third World' is short life and large family.' So this is what I could display here. I put fertility rate here -- number of children per woman: one, two, three, four, up to about eight children per woman. We have very good data since 1962, 1960, about, on the size of families in all countries. The error margin is narrow. Here, I put life expectancy at birth, from 30 years in some countries, up to about 70 years. And in 1962, there was really a group of countries here that were industrialized countries, and they had small families and long lives. And these were the developing countries. They had large families and they had relatively short lives. Now, what has happened since 1962? We want to see the change. Are the students right? It's still two types of countries? Or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here? Or have they got longer lives and live up there? Let's see. We start the world, eh? This is all UN statistics that have been available. Here we go. Can you see there? It's China there, moving against better health there, improving there. All the green Latin American countries are moving towards smaller families. Your yellow ones here are the Arabic countries, and they get longer life, but not larger families. The Africans are the green here. They still remain here. This is India; Indonesia is moving on pretty fast. In the '80s here, you have Bangladesh still among the African countries. But now, Bangladesh -- it's a miracle that happens in the '80s -- the imams start to promote family planning, and they move up into that corner. And in the '90s, we have the terrible HIV epidemic that takes down the life expectancy of the African countries. And the rest of them all move up into the corner, where we have long lives and small family, and we have a completely new world. (Applause) (Applause ends) Let me make a comparison directly between the United States of America and Vietnam. 1964: America had small families and long life; Vietnam had large families and short lives. And this is what happens. The data during the war indicate that even with all the death, there was an improvement of life expectancy. By the end of the year, family planning started in Vietnam, and they went for smaller families. And the United States up there is getting longer life, keeping family size. And in the '80s now, they give up Communist planning and they go for market economy, and it moves faster even than social life. And today, we have in Vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size here in Vietnam, 2003, as in United States, 1974, by the end of the war. I think we all, if we don't look at the data, we underestimate the tremendous change in Asia, which was in social change before we saw the economic change. So let's move over to another way here in which we could display the distribution in the world of income. This is the world distribution of income of people. One dollar, 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day. There's no gap between rich and poor any longer. This is a myth. There's a little hump here. But there are people all the way. And if we look where the income ends up, this is 100 percent of the world's annual income. And the richest 20 percent, they take out of that about 74 percent. And the poorest 20 percent, they take about two percent. And this shows that the concept of developing countries is extremely doubtful. We think about aid, like these people here giving aid to these people here. But in the middle, we have most of the world population, and they have now 24 percent of the income. We heard it in other forms. And who are these? Where are the different countries? I can show you Africa. This is Africa. Ten percent of the world population, most in poverty. This is OECD -- the rich countries, the country club of the UN. And they are over here on this side. Quite an overlap between Africa and OECD. And this is Latin America. It has everything on this earth, from the poorest to the richest in Latin America. And on top of that, we can put East Europe, we can put East Asia, and we put South Asia. And what did it look like if we go back in time, to about 1970? Then, there was more of a hump. And most who lived in absolute poverty were Asians. The problem in the world was the poverty in Asia. And if I now let the world move forward, you will see that while population increases, there are hundreds of millions in Asia getting out of poverty, and some others getting into poverty, and this is the pattern we have today. And the best projection from the World Bank is that this will happen, and we will not have a divided world. We'll have most people in the middle. Of course it's a logarithmic scale here, but our concept of economy is growth with percent. We look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase. If I change this and take GDP per capita instead of family income, and I turn these individual data into regional data of gross domestic product, and I take the regions down here, the size of the bubble is still the population. And you have the OECD there, and you have sub-Saharan Africa there, and we take off the Arab states there, coming both from Africa and from Asia, and we put them separately, and we can expand this axis, and I can give it a new dimension here, by adding the social values there, child survival. Now I have money on that axis, and I have the possibility of children to survive there. In some countries, 99.7% of children survive to five years of age; others, only 70. And here, it seems, there is a gap between OECD, Latin America, East Europe, East Asia, Arab states, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The linearity is very strong between child survival and money. But let me split sub-Saharan Africa. Health is there and better health is up there. I can go here, and I can split sub-Saharan Africa into its countries. And when it bursts, the size of each country bubble is the size of the population. Sierra Leone down there, Mauritius is up there. Mauritius was the first country to get away with trade barriers, and they could sell their sugar, they could sell their textiles, on equal terms as the people in Europe and North America. There's a huge difference [within] Africa. And Ghana is here in the middle. In Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid. Here in Uganda, development aid. Here, time to invest; there, you can go for a holiday. There's tremendous variation within Africa, which we very often make that it's equal everything. I can split South Asia here. India's the big bubble in the middle. But there's a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. I can split Arab states. How are they? Same climate, same culture, same religion -- huge difference. Even between neighbors -- Yemen, civil war; United Arab Emirates, money, which was quite equally and well-used. Not as the myth is. And that includes all the children of the foreign workers who are in the country. Data is often better than you think. Many people say data is bad. There is an uncertainty margin, but we can see the difference here: Cambodia, Singapore. The differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data. East Europe: Soviet economy for a long time, but they come out after 10 years very, very differently. And there is Latin America. Today, we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin America. Chile will have a lower child mortality than Cuba within some few years from now. Here, we have high-income countries in the OECD. And we get the whole pattern here of the world, which is more or less like this. And if we look at it, how the world looks, in 1960, it starts to move. This is Mao Zedong. He brought health to China. And then he died. And then Deng Xiaoping came and brought money to China, and brought them into the mainstream again. And we have seen how countries move in different directions like this, so it's sort of difficult to get an example country which shows the pattern of the world. But I would like to bring you back to about here, at 1960. I would like to compare South Korea, which is this one, with Brazil, which is this one. The label went away for me here. And I would like to compare Uganda, which is there. I can run it forward, like this. And you can see how South Korea is making a very, very fast advancement, whereas Brazil is much slower. And if we move back again, here, and we put trails on them, like this, you can see again that the speed of development is very, very different, and the countries are moving more or less at the same rate as money and health, but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first. And to show that, you can put on the way of United Arab Emirates. They came from here, a mineral country. They cached all the oil; they got all the money; but health cannot be bought at the supermarket. You have to invest in health. You have to get kids into schooling. You have to train health staff. You have to educate the population. And Sheikh Zayed did that in a fairly good way. In spite of falling oil prices, he brought this country up here. So we've got a much more mainstream appearance of the world, where all countries tend to use their money better than they used it in the past. Now, this is, more or less, if you look at the average data of the countries -- they are like this. That's dangerous, to use average data, because there is such a lot of difference within countries. So if I go and look here, we can see that Uganda today is where South Korea was in 1960. If I split Uganda, there's quite a difference within Uganda. These are the quintiles of Uganda. The richest 20 percent of Ugandans are there. The poorest are down there. If I split South Africa, it's like this. And if I go down and look at Niger, where there was such a terrible famine [recently], it's like this. The 20 percent poorest of Niger is out here, and the 20 percent richest of South Africa is there, and yet we tend to discuss what solutions there should be in Africa. Everything in this world exists in Africa. And you can't discuss universal access to HIV [treatment] for that quintile up here with the same strategy as down here. The improvement of the world must be highly contextualized, and it's not relevant to have it on a regional level. We must be much more detailed. We find that students get very excited when they can use this. And even more, policy makers and the corporate sectors would like to see how the world is changing. Now, why doesn't this take place? Why are we not using the data we have? We have data in the United Nations, in the national statistical agencies and in universities and other nongovernmental organizations. Because the data is hidden down in the databases. And the public is there, and the internet is there, but we have still not used it effectively. All that information we saw changing in the world does not include publicly funded statistics. There are some web pages like this, you know, but they take some nourishment down from the databases, but people put prices on them, stupid passwords and boring statistics. (Laughter) And this won't work. (Applause) So what is needed? We have the databases. It's not a new database that you need. We have wonderful design tools and more and more are added up here. So we started a nonprofit venture linking data to design, we called 'Gapminder,' from the London Underground, where they warn you, 'Mind the gap.' So we thought Gapminder was appropriate. And we started to write software which could link the data like this. And it wasn't that difficult. It took some person years, and we have produced animations. You can take a data set and put it there. We are liberating UN data, some few UN organization. Some countries accept that their databases can go out on the world. But what we really need is, of course, a search function, a search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world. And what do we hear when we go around? I've done anthropology on the main statistical units. Everyone says, 'It's impossible. This can't be done. Our information is so peculiar in detail, so that cannot be searched as others can be searched. We cannot give the data free to the students, free to the entrepreneurs of the world.' But this is what we would like to see, isn't it? The publicly funded data is down here. And we would like flowers to grow out on the net. One of the crucial points is to make them searchable, and then people can use the different design tools to animate it there. And I have pretty good news for you. I have good news that the [current], new head of UN statistics doesn't say it's impossible. He only says, 'We can't do it.' (Laughter) And that's a quite clever guy, huh? (Laughter) So we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years. We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways. This is the income distribution of China, 1970. This is the income distribution of the United States, 1970. Almost no overlap. Almost no overlap. And what has happened? What has happened is this: that China is growing, it's not so equal any longer, and it's appearing here, overlooking the United States, almost like a ghost, isn't it? (Laughter) It's pretty scary. (Laughter) But I think it's very important to have all this information. We need really to see it. And instead of looking at this, I would like to end up by showing the internet users per 1,000. In this software, we access about 500 variables from all the countries quite easily. It takes some time to change for this, but on the axes, you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have. And the thing would be to get up the databases free, to get them searchable, and with a second click, to get them into the graphic formats, where you can instantly understand them. Now, statisticians don't like it, because they say that this will not show the reality; we have to have statistical, analytical methods. But this is hypothesis-generating. I end now with the world. There, the internet is coming. The number of internet users are going up like this. This is the GDP per capita. And it's a new technology coming in, but then amazingly, how well it fits to the economy of the countries. That's why the $100 computer will be so important. But it's a nice tendency. It's as if the world is flattening off, isn't it? These countries are lifting more than the economy, and it will be very interesting to follow this over the year, as I would like you to be able to do with all the publicly funded data. Thank you very much. (Applause)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Good morning. How are you? (Audience) Good. It's been great, hasn't it? I've been blown away by the whole thing. In fact, I'm leaving. (Laughter) There have been three themes running through the conference, which are relevant to what I want to talk about. One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here; just the variety of it and the range of it. The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen in terms of the future. No idea how this may play out. I have an interest in education. Actually, what I find is, everybody has an interest in education. Don't you? I find this very interesting. If you're at a dinner party, and you say you work in education -- actually, you're not often at dinner parties, frankly. (Laughter) If you work in education, you're not asked. (Laughter) And you're never asked back, curiously. That's strange to me. But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, 'What do you do?' and you say you work in education, you can see the blood run from their face. They're like, 'Oh my God. Why me?' (Laughter) 'My one night out all week.' (Laughter) But if you ask about their education, they pin you to the wall, because it's one of those things that goes deep with people, am I right? Like religion and money and other things. So I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do. We have a huge vested interest in it, partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp. If you think of it, children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065. Nobody has a clue, despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days, what the world will look like in five years' time. And yet, we're meant to be educating them for it. So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary. And the third part of this is that we've all agreed, nonetheless, on the really extraordinary capacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation. I mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn't she? Just seeing what she could do. And she's exceptional, but I think she's not, so to speak, exceptional in the whole of childhood. What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent. And my contention is, all kids have tremendous talents, and we squander them, pretty ruthlessly. So I want to talk about education, and I want to talk about creativity. My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) That was it, by the way. Thank you very much. (Laughter) So, 15 minutes left. (Laughter) 'Well, I was born ... ' (Laughter) I heard a great story recently -- I love telling it -- of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson. She was six, and she was at the back, drawing, and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention, and in this drawing lesson, she did. The teacher was fascinated. She went over to her, and she said, 'What are you drawing?' And the girl said, 'I'm drawing a picture of God.' And the teacher said, 'But nobody knows what God looks like.' And the girl said, 'They will in a minute.' (Laughter) When my son was four in England -- actually, he was four everywhere, to be honest. (Laughter) If we're being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year. He was in the Nativity play. Do you remember the story? (Laughter) No, it was big, it was a big story. Mel Gibson did the sequel, you may have seen it. (Laughter) 'Nativity II.' But James got the part of Joseph, which we were thrilled about. We considered this to be one of the lead parts. We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts: 'James Robinson IS Joseph!' (Laughter) He didn't have to speak, but you know the bit where the three kings come in? They come in bearing gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh. This really happened. We were sitting there, and I think they just went out of sequence, because we talked to the little boy afterward and said, 'You OK with that?' They said, 'Yeah, why? Was that wrong?' They just switched. The three boys came in, four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads. They put these boxes down, and the first boy said, 'I bring you gold.' And the second boy said, 'I bring you myrrh.' And the third boy said, 'Frank sent this.' (Laughter) What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance. If they don't know, they'll have a go. Am I right? They're not frightened of being wrong. I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative. What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original -- if you're not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities. Picasso once said this, he said that all children are born artists. The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up. I believe this passionately, that we don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it. Or rather, we get educated out of it. So why is this? I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago. In fact, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles. So you can imagine what a seamless transition this was. (Laughter) Actually, we lived in a place called Snitterfield, just outside Stratford, which is where Shakespeare's father was born. Are you struck by a new thought? I was. You don't think of Shakespeare having a father, do you? Do you? Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child, do you? Shakespeare being seven? I never thought of it. I mean, he was seven at some point. He was in somebody's English class, wasn't he? (Laughter) How annoying would that be? (Laughter) 'Must try harder.' (Laughter) Being sent to bed by his dad, to Shakespeare, 'Go to bed, now!' To William Shakespeare. 'And put the pencil down!' (Laughter) 'And stop speaking like that.' (Laughter) 'It's confusing everybody.' (Laughter) Anyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles, and I just want to say a word about the transition. Actually, my son didn't want to come. I've got two kids; he's 21 now, my daughter's 16. He didn't want to come to Los Angeles. He loved it, but he had a girlfriend in England. This was the love of his life, Sarah. He'd known her for a month. (Laughter) Mind you, they'd had their fourth anniversary, because it's a long time when you're 16. He was really upset on the plane. He said, 'I'll never find another girl like Sarah.' And we were rather pleased about that, frankly -- (Laughter) because she was the main reason we were leaving the country. (Laughter) But something strikes you when you move to America and travel around the world: every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects. Every one. Doesn't matter where you go. You'd think it would be otherwise, but it isn't. At the top are mathematics and languages, then the humanities. At the bottom are the arts. Everywhere on earth. And in pretty much every system, too, there's a hierarchy within the arts. Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance. There isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why? Why not? I think this is rather important. I think math is very important, but so is dance. Children dance all the time if they're allowed to, we all do. We all have bodies, don't we? Did I miss a meeting? (Laughter) Truthfully, what happens is, as children grow up, we start to educate them progressively from the waist up. And then we focus on their heads. And slightly to one side. If you were to visit education as an alien and say 'What's it for, public education?' I think you'd have to conclude, if you look at the output, who really succeeds by this, who does everything they should, who gets all the brownie points, who are the winners -- I think you'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors. Isn't it? They're the people who come out the top. And I used to be one, so there. (Laughter) And I like university professors, but, you know, we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement. They're just a form of life. Another form of life. But they're rather curious. And I say this out of affection for them: there's something curious about professors. In my experience -- not all of them, but typically -- they live in their heads. They live up there and slightly to one side. They're disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way. They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads. (Laughter) Don't they? It's a way of getting their head to meetings. (Laughter) If you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences, by the way, get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics and pop into the discotheque on the final night. (Laughter) And there, you will see it. Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably, off the beat. (Laughter) Waiting until it ends, so they can go home and write a paper about it. (Laughter) Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability. And there's a reason. Around the world, there were no public systems of education, really, before the 19th century. They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism. So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas. Number one, that the most useful subjects for work are at the top. So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid, things you liked, on the grounds you would never get a job doing that. Is that right? 'Don't do music, you're not going to be a musician; don't do art, you won't be an artist.' Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken. The whole world is engulfed in a revolution. And the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence, because the universities design the system in their image. If you think of it, the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance. And the consequence is that many highly talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not, because the thing they were good at at school wasn't valued, or was actually stigmatized. And I think we can't afford to go on that way. In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history. More people. And it's the combination of all the things we've talked about: technology and its transformational effect on work, and demography and the huge explosion in population. Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything. Isn't that true? When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job. If you didn't have a job, it's because you didn't want one. And I didn't want one, frankly. (Laughter) But now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games, because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA, and now you need a PhD for the other. It's a process of academic inflation. And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet. We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence. We know three things about intelligence. One, it's diverse. We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it. We think visually, we think in sound, we think kinesthetically. We think in abstract terms, we think in movement. Secondly, intelligence is dynamic. If you look at the interactions of a human brain, as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations, intelligence is wonderfully interactive. The brain isn't divided into compartments. In fact, creativity -- which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things. By the way, there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain, called the corpus callosum. It's thicker in women. Following off from Helen yesterday, this is probably why women are better at multitasking. Because you are, aren't you? There's a raft of research, but I know it from my personal life. If my wife is cooking a meal at home, which is not often ... thankfully. (Laughter) No, she's good at some things. But if she's cooking, she's dealing with people on the phone, she's talking to the kids, she's painting the ceiling -- (Laughter) she's doing open-heart surgery over here. If I'm cooking, the door is shut, the kids are out, the phone's on the hook, if she comes in, I get annoyed. I say, 'Terry, please, I'm trying to fry an egg in here.' (Laughter) 'Give me a break.' (Laughter) Actually, do you know that old philosophical thing, 'If a tree falls in a forest, and nobody hears it, did it happen?' Remember that old chestnut? I saw a great T-shirt recently, which said, 'If a man speaks his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him, is he still wrong?' (Laughter) And the third thing about intelligence is, it's distinct. I'm doing a new book at the moment called 'Epiphany,' which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent. I'm fascinated by how people got to be there. It's really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of, Gillian Lynne. Have you heard of her? Some have. She's a choreographer, and everybody knows her work. She did 'Cats' and 'Phantom of the Opera.' She's wonderful. I used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet, as you can see. (Laughter) Gillian and I had lunch one day. I said, 'How did you get to be a dancer?' It was interesting. When she was at school, she was really hopeless. And the school, in the '30s, wrote to her parents and said, 'We think Gillian has a learning disorder.' She couldn't concentrate; she was fidgeting. I think now they'd say she had ADHD. Wouldn't you? But this was the 1930s, and ADHD hadn't been invented at this point. It wasn't an available condition. (Laughter) People weren't aware they could have that. (Laughter) Anyway, she went to see this specialist. So, this oak-paneled room, and she was there with her mother, and she was led and sat on this chair at the end, and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes, while this man talked to her mother about all the problems Gillian was having at school, because she was disturbing people, her homework was always late, and so on. Little kid of eight. In the end, the doctor went and sat next to Gillian and said, 'I've listened to all these things your mother's told me. I need to speak to her privately. Wait here. We'll be back. We won't be very long,' and they went and left her. But as they went out of the room, he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk. And when they got out of the room, he said to her mother, 'Just stand and watch her.' And the minute they left the room, she was on her feet, moving to the music. And they watched for a few minutes, and he turned to her mother and said, 'Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn't sick. She's a dancer. Take her to a dance school.' I said, 'What happened?' She said, 'She did. I can't tell you how wonderful it was. We walked in this room, and it was full of people like me -- people who couldn't sit still, people who had to move to think.' Who had to move to think. They did ballet, they did tap, jazz; they did modern; they did contemporary. She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School. She became a soloist; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet. She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School, founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company, met Andrew Lloyd Webber. She's been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history, she's given pleasure to millions, and she's a multimillionaire. Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down. (Applause) What I think it comes to is this: Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson. I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology, one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity. Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth for a particular commodity. And for the future, it won't serve us. We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we're educating our children. There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk, who said, 'If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth, within 50 years, all life on Earth would end. If all human beings disappeared from the Earth, within 50 years, all forms of life would flourish.' And he's right. What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination. We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely, and that we avert some of the scenarios that we've talked about. And the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are. And our task is to educate their whole being, so they can face this future. By the way -- we may not see this future, but they will. And our job is to help them make something of it. Thank you very much. (Applause)</td>\n",

       "      <td>If you're here today -- and I'm very happy that you are -- you've all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselves. However, when we're not at TED, we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible, especially in large urban areas like New York City. And that's because most people with decision-making powers, in both the public and the private sector, really don't feel as though they're in danger. The reason why I'm here today, in part, is because of a dog -- an abandoned puppy I found back in the rain, back in 1998. She turned out to be a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated. When she came into my life, we were fighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront despite the fact that our small part of New York City already handled more than 40 percent of the entire city's commercial waste: a sewage treatment pelletizing plant, a sewage sludge plant, four power plants, the world's largest food-distribution center, as well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each week. The area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city. So when I was contacted by the Parks Department about a $10,000 seed-grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects, I thought they were really well-meaning, but a bit naive. I'd lived in this area all my life, and you could not get to the river, because of all the lovely facilities that I mentioned earlier. Then, while jogging with my dog one morning, she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump. There were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won't mention here, but she kept dragging me, and lo and behold, at the end of that lot was the river. I knew that this forgotten little street-end, abandoned like the dog that brought me there, was worth saving. And I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community-led revitalization of the new South Bronx. And just like my new dog, it was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined. We garnered much support along the way, and the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park that the South Bronx had had in more than 60 years. We leveraged that $10,000 seed grant more than 300 times, into a $3 million park. And in the fall, I'm going to exchange marriage vows with my beloved. (Audience whistles) Thank you very much. (Applause) That's him pressing my buttons back there, which he does all the time. (Laughter) (Applause) But those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mine. We feel the problems right now, and have for some time. Environmental justice, for those of you who may not be familiar with the term, goes something like this: no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other. Unfortunately, race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff, like parks and trees, and where one might find the bad stuff, like power plants and waste facilities. As a black person in America, I am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health. I am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility, which I do. These land-use decisions created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity, diabetes and asthma. Why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood? Our 27 percent obesity rate is high even for this country, and diabetes comes with it. One out of four South Bronx children has asthma. Our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national average. These impacts are coming everyone's way. And we all pay dearly for solid waste costs, health problems associated with pollution and more odiously, the cost of imprisoning our young black and Latino men, who possess untold amounts of untapped potential. Fifty percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line; 25 percent of us are unemployed. Low-income citizens often use emergency-room visits as primary care. This comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits. Poor people are not only still poor, they are still unhealthy. Fortunately, there are many people like me who are striving for solutions that won't compromise the lives of low-income communities of color in the short term, and won't destroy us all in the long term. None of us want that, and we all have that in common. So what else do we have in common? Well, first of all, we're all incredibly good-looking. (Laughter) Graduated high school, college, post-graduate degrees, traveled to interesting places, didn't have kids in your early teens, financially stable, never been imprisoned. OK. Good. (Laughter) But, besides being a black woman, I am different from most of you in some other ways. I watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down. My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam, only to be gunned down a few blocks from our home. Jesus. I grew up with a crack house across the street. Yeah, I'm a poor black child from the ghetto. These things make me different from you. But the things we have in common set me apart from most of the people in my community, and I am in between these two worlds with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other. So how did things get so different for us? In the late '40s, my dad -- a Pullman porter, son of a slave -- bought a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx, and a few years later, he married my mom. At the time, the community was a mostly white, working-class neighborhood. My dad was not alone. And as others like him pursued their own version of the American dream, white flight became common in the South Bronx and in many cities around the country. Red-lining was used by banks, wherein certain sections of the city, including ours, were deemed off-limits to any sort of investment. Many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions -- dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding. Hunts Point was formerly a walk-to-work community, but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to. A national highway construction boom was added to our problems. In New York State, Robert Moses spearheaded an aggressive highway-expansion campaign. One of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan. The South Bronx, which lies in between, did not stand a chance. Residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were razed. 600,000 people were displaced. The common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx. And if you are told from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come from your community, that it's bad and ugly, how could it not reflect on you? So now, my family's property was worthless, save for that it was our home, and all we had. And luckily for me, that home and the love inside of it, along with help from teachers, mentors and friends along the way, was enough. Now, why is this story important? Because from a planning perspective, economic degradation begets environmental degradation, which begets social degradation. The disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come. Antiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood. Are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided? What costs are associated with these decisions? And who pays? Who profits? Does anything justify what the local community goes through? This was 'planning' -- in quotes -- that did not have our best interests in mind. Once we realized that, we decided it was time to do our own planning. That small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of building a Greenway movement in the South Bronx. I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade with dedicated on-street bike paths. Physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety, the placement of the waste and other facilities, which, if done properly, don't compromise a community's quality of life. They provide opportunities to be more physically active, as well as local economic development. Think bike shops, juice stands. We secured 20 million dollars to build first-phase projects. This is Lafayette Avenue -- and that's redesigned by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects. And once this path is constructed, it'll connect the South Bronx with more than 400 acres of Randall's Island Park. Right now we're separated by about 25 feet of water, but this link will change that. As we nurture the natural environment, its abundance will give us back even more. We run a project called the Bronx [Environmental] Stewardship Training, which provides job training in the fields of ecological restoration, so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these well-paying jobs. Little by little, we're seeding the area with green-collar jobs -- and with people that have both a financial and personal stake in their environment. The Sheridan Expressway is an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era, built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it. Even during rush hour, it goes virtually unused. The community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway. We have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to re-envision how this 28 acres can be better utilized for parkland, affordable housing and local economic development. We also built New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices. Cool roofs are highly-reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat, and pass it on to the building or atmosphere. Green roofs are soil and living plants. Both can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat, contribute to urban 'heat island' effect and degrade under the sun, which we in turn breathe. Green roofs also retain up to 75 percent of rainfall, so they reduce a city's need to fund costly end-of-pipe solutions -- which, incidentally, are often located in environmental justice communities like mine. And they provide habitats for our little friends! [Butterfly] (Laughter) So cool! Anyway, the demonstration project is a springboard for our own green roof installation business, bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx. [Green is the new black ...] (Laughter) (Applause) I like that, too. Anyway, I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here, but since I have all of your attention: We need investors. End of pitch. It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission. Anyway -- (Laughter) (Applause) OK. Katrina. Prior to Katrina, the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward had a lot in common. Both were largely populated by poor people of color, both hotbeds of cultural innovation: think hip-hop and jazz. Both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another. In the post-Katrina era, we have still more in common. We're at best ignored, and maligned and abused, at worst, by negligent regulatory agencies, pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability. Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable. But we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out. We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone. Now will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two, like the South Bronx did? Or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation in communities like mine? Now listen, I do not expect individuals, corporations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moral. This presentation today only represents some of what I've been through. Like a tiny little bit. You've no clue. But I'll tell you later, if you want to know. (Laughter) But -- I know it's the bottom line, or one's perception of it, that motivates people in the end. I'm interested in what I like to call the 'triple bottom line' that sustainable development can produce. Developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned: the developers, government and the community where these projects go up. At present, that's not happening in New York City. And we are operating with a comprehensive urban-planning deficit. A parade of government subsidies is going to propose big-box and stadium developments in the South Bronx, but there is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic, pollution, solid waste and the impacts on open space. And their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame it's not even funny. Because on top of that, the world's richest sports team is replacing the House That Ruth Built by destroying two well-loved community parks. Now, we'll have even less than that stat I told you about earlier. And although less than 25 percent of South Bronx residents own cars, these projects include thousands of new parking spaces, yet zip in terms of mass public transit. Now, what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy, environmentally-challenged community, versus incorporating structural, sustainable changes. My agency is working closely with Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issues. Now let's get this straight: I am not anti-development. Ours is a city, not a wilderness preserve. And I've embraced my inner capitalist. And, but I don't have -- (Laughter) You probably all have, and if you haven't, you need to. (Laughter) So I don't have a problem with developers making money. There's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable, community-friendly development can still make a fortune. Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins -- both heroes of mine by the way -- have shown that you can actually do that. I do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit. That it continues is a shame upon us all, because we are all responsible for the future that we create. But one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities, is to learn from visionaries in other cities. This is my version of globalization. Let's take Bogota. Poor, Latino, surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking; a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx. However, this city was blessed in the late 1990s with a highly-influential mayor named Enrique Peñalosa. He looked at the demographics. Few Bogotanos own cars, yet a huge portion of the city's resources was dedicated to serving them. If you're a mayor, you can do something about that. His administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three, outlawed parking on those streets, expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes, created public plazas, created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems in the entire world. For his brilliant efforts, he was nearly impeached. But as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day-to-day lives, incredible things happened. People stopped littering. Crime rates dropped, because the streets were alive with people. His administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time, and on a third-world budget, at that. We have no excuse in this country, I'm sorry. But the bottom line is: their people-first agenda was not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars, but rather, to provide opportunities for all Bogotanos to participate in the city's resurgence. That development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical idea here in the U.S. But Bogota's example has the power to change that. You, however, are blessed with the gift of influence. That's why you're here and why you value the information we exchange. Use your influence in support of comprehensive, sustainable change everywhere. Don't just talk about it at TED. This is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to build, and as you all know, politics are personal. Help me make green the new black. Help me make sustainability sexy. Make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations. Help me fight for environmental and economic justice. Support investments with a triple-bottom-line return. Help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table, and insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere. Oh good, glad I have a little more time! Listen -- when I spoke to Mr. Gore the other day after breakfast, I asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included in his new marketing strategy. His response was a grant program. I don't think he understood that I wasn't asking for funding. I was making him an offer. (Applause) What troubled me was that this top-down approach is still around. Now, don't get me wrong, we need money. (Laughter) But grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision-making process. Of the 90 percent of the energy that Mr. Gore reminded us that we waste every day, don't add wasting our energy, intelligence and hard-earned experience to that count. (Applause) I have come from so far to meet you like this. Please don't waste me. By working together, we can become one of those small, rapidly-growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world. We might have come to this conference from very, very different stations in life, but believe me, we all share one incredibly powerful thing. We have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Ciao, bellos! (Applause)</td>\n",

I called on a Monday morning. Now it's evening, and my dinner first grew cold, and then grew mold. I'm still on hold. I'm listening to the sounds of silence. I don't think you understand. I think your phone lines are unmanned. I punched every touch tone I was told, but I've still spent 18 hours on hold. It's not enough your software crashed my Mac, and it constantly hangs and bombs -- it erased my ROMs! Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence. In my dreams I fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys. Say your motorcycle crashes. Blood comes gushing from your gashes. With your fading strength, you call 9-1-1 and you pray for a trained MD. But you get me. (Laughter) And you listen to the sounds of silence. (Music) (Applause) Thank you. Good evening and welcome to: 'Spot the TED Presenter Who Used to Be a Broadway Accompanist.' (Laughter) When I was offered the Times column six years ago, the deal was like this: you'll be sent the coolest, hottest, slickest new gadgets. Every week, it'll arrive at your door. You get to try them out, play with them, evaluate them until the novelty wears out, before you have to send them back, and you'll get paid for it. You can think about it, if you want. So, I've always been a technology nut, and I absolutely love it. The job, though, came with one small downside, and that is, they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column. And what I've noticed is -- first of all, you get an incredible amount of email. If you ever are feeling lonely, get a New York Times column, because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails. And the email I'm getting a lot today is about frustration. People are feeling like things -- Ok, I just had an alarm come up on my screen. Lucky you can't see it. People are feeling overwhelmed. They're feeling like it's too much technology, too fast. It may be good technology, but I feel like there's not enough of a support structure. There's not enough help. There's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use. One time I wrote a column about my efforts to reach Dell Technical Support, and within 12 hours, there were 700 messages from readers on the feedback boards on the Times website, from users saying, ''Me too, and here's my tale of woe.' I call it 'software rage.' And man, let me tell you, whoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will -- Oh, how did that get up there? Just kidding. (Laughter) Ok, so why is the problem accelerating? And part of the problem is, ironically, because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use. I'll show you what I mean. This is what the computer interface used to look like, DOS. Over the years, it's gotten easier to use. This is the original Mac operating system. Reagan was President. Madonna was still a brunette. And the entire operating system -- this is the good part -- the entire operating system fit in 211 k. You couldn't put the Mac OS X logo in 211 k! (Laughter) So the irony is, that as these things became easier to use, a less technical, broader audience was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time. I once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the Apple call center for a day. The guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to. And the calls that -- you know how they say, 'Your call may be recorded for quality assurance?' Uh-uh. Your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a CD. (Laughter) Which they do. (Laughter) And I have a copy. (Laughter) It's in your gift bag. No, no. With your voices on it! So, some of the stories are just so classic, and yet so understandable. A woman called Apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking. Making a squeaking noise. And the technician said, 'Well, ma'am, what do you mean your mouse is squeaking?' She says, 'All I can tell you is that it squeaks louder, the faster I move it across the screen.' (Laughter) And the technician's like, 'Ma'am, you've got the mouse up against the screen?' She goes, 'Well, the message said, 'Click here to continue.'' (Laughter) Well, if you like that one -- how much time have we got? Another one, a guy called -- this is absolutely true -- his computer had crashed, and he told the technician he couldn't restart it, no matter how many times he typed '11.' And the technician said, 'What? Why are you typing 11?' He said, 'The message says, 'Error Type 11.'' (Laughter) So, we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users. But why is the technical overload crisis, the complexity crisis, accelerating now? In the hardware world, it's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller, smaller, smaller. So the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier, but our fingers are essentially staying the same size. So it gets to be more and more of a challenge. Software is subject to another primal force: the mandate to release more and more versions. When you buy a piece of software, it's not like buying a vase or a candy bar, where you own it. It's more like joining a club, where you pay dues every year, and every year, they say, 'We've added more features, and we'll sell it to you for $99.' I know one guy who's spent $4,000 just on Photoshop over the years. And software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades. I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox -- which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times, you eventually ruin it. I mean, Microsoft Word was last just a word processor in, you know, the Eisenhower administration. (Laughter) But what's the alternative? Microsoft actually did this experiment. They said, 'Well, wait a minute. Everyone complains that we're adding so many features. Let's create a word processor that's just a word processor: Simple, pure; does not do web pages, is not a database.' And it came out, and it was called Microsoft Write. And none of you are nodding in acknowledgment, because it died. It tanked. No one ever bought it. I call this the Sport Utility Principle. People like to surround themselves with unnecessary power, right? They don't need the database and the website, but they're like, 'Well, I'll upgrade, because, I might, you know, I might need that someday.' So the problem is: as you add more features, where are they going to go? Where are you going to stick them? You only have so many design tools. You can do buttons, you can do sliders, pop-up menus, sub-menus. But if you're not careful about how you choose, you wind up with this. (Laughter) This is an un-retouched -- this is not a joke -- un-retouched photo of Microsoft Word, the copy that you have, with all the toolbars open. You've obviously never opened all the toolbars, but all you have to type in is this little, teeny window down here. (Laughter) And we've arrived at the age of interface matrices, where there are so many features and options, you have to do two dimensions, you know: a vertical and a horizontal. You guys all complain about how Microsoft Word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically. The off switch is in there somewhere. I'm telling you -- it's there. Part of the art of designing a simple, good interface, is knowing when to use which one of these features. So, here is the log-off dialogue box for Windows 2000. There are only four choices, so why are they in a pop-up menu? It's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices. They could have put them all out in view. Here's Apple's take on the exact same dialogue box. (Applause) Thank you -- yes, I designed the dialogue box. No, no. Already, we can see that Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design. Microsoft's approach to simplicity tends to be: let's break it down; let's just make it more steps. There are these 'wizards' everywhere. And you know, there's a new version of Windows coming out this fall. If they continue at this pace, there's absolutely no telling where they might wind up. [Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard] (Laughter) (Applause) 'Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard.' Ok, I'll bite. Let's click 'Next' to continue. (Laughter) (Applause) From the drop-down menu, choose the first letter you want to type. Ok. (Laughter) So there is a limit that we don't want to cross. So what is the answer? How do you pack in all these features in a simple, intelligent way? I believe in consistency, when possible, real-world equivalents, trash can folder, when possible, label things, mostly. But I beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all, which is intelligence. Now what do I mean by that? I'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent, but it's better. If you are buying something on the web, you're supposed to put in your address, and you're supposed to choose what country you're from, ok? There are 200 countries in the world. We like to think of the Internet as a global village. I'm sorry; it's not one yet. It's mainly like, the United States, Europe, and Japan. So why is 'United States' in the 'U's? (Laughter) You have to scroll, like, seven screensful to get to it. Now, it would be inconsistent to put 'United States' first, but it would be intelligent. This one's been touched on before, but why in God's name do you shut down a Windows PC by clicking a button called 'Start?' (Laughter) Here's another pet one of mine: you have a printer. Most of the time, you want to print one copy of your document, in page order, on that printer. So why in God's name do you see this every time you print? It's like a 747 shuttle cockpit. (Laughter) And one of the buttons at the bottom, you'll notice, is not 'Print.' (Laughter) (Applause) Now, I'm not saying that Apple is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity. Palm is also, especially in the old days, wonderful about this. I actually got to speak to Palm when they were flying high in the '90s, and after the talk, I met one of the employees. He says, 'Nice talk.' And I said, 'Thank you. What do you do here?' He said, 'I'm a tap counter.' I'm like, 'You're a what?' He goes, 'Well Jeff Hawkins, the CEO, says, 'If any task on the Palm Pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus, it's too long, and it has to be redesigned.' So I'm the tap counter.' So, I'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter. (Laughter) This is Microsoft Word. Ok, when you want to create a new blank document in Word -- it could happen. (Laughter) You go up to the 'File' menu and you choose 'New.' Now, what happens when you choose 'New?' Do you get a new blank document? You do not. On the opposite side of the monitor, a task bar appears, and somewhere in those links -- by the way, not at the top -- somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document. Ok, so that is a company not counting taps. You know, I don't want to just stand here and make fun of Microsoft ... Yes, I do. (Laughter) (Applause) The Bill Gates song! (Piano music) I've been a geek forever and I wrote the very first DOS. I put my software and IBM together; I got profit and they got the loss. (Laughter) I write the code that makes the whole world run. I'm getting royalties from everyone. Sometimes it's garbage, but the press is snowed. You buy the box; I'll sell the code. Every software company is doing Microsoft's R and D. You can't keep a good idea down these days. Even Windows is a hack. We're kind of based loosely on the Mac. So it's big, so it's slow. You've got nowhere to go. I'm not doing this for praise. I write the code that fits the world today. Big mediocrity in every way. We've entered planet domination mode. You'll have no choice; you'll buy my code. I am Bill Gates and I write the code. (Applause) But actually, I believe there are really two Microsofts. There's the old one, responsible for Windows and Office. They're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh, but they can't. They're locked in, because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis. But there's also a new Microsoft, that's really doing good, simple interface designs. I liked the Media Center PC. I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch. The Wireless Watch flopped miserably in the market, but it wasn't because it wasn't simply and beautifully designed. But let's put it this way: would you pay $10 a month to have a watch that has to be recharged every night like your cell phone, and stops working when you leave your area code? (Laughter) So, the signs might indicate that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse. So is there any hope? The screens are getting smaller, people are illuminating, putting manuals in the boxes, things are coming out at a faster pace. It's funny -- when Steve Jobs came back to Apple in 1997, after 12 years away, it was the MacWorld Expo -- he came to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans, and he sort of did this. The crowd went wild, but I had just seen -- I'm like, where have I seen this before? I had just seen the movie 'Evita' -- (Laughter) with Madonna, and I'm like, you know what? I've got to do one about Steve Jobs. (Music) It won't be easy. You'll think I'm strange. (Laughter) When I try to explain why I'm back, after telling the press Apple's future is black. You won't believe me. All that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a buddy named Woz. (Laughter) You try rhyming with garage! (Laughter) Don't cry for me, Cupertino. (Laughter) The truth is, I never left you. I know the ropes now, know what the tricks are. I made a fortune over at Pixar. (Laughter) Don't cry for me, Cupertino. I've still got the drive and vision. I still wear sandals in any weather. It's just that these days, they're Gucci leather. (Laughter) (Applause) Thank you. So Steve Jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty. And the truth is, for years I was a little depressed, because Americans obviously did not value it, because the Mac had three percent market share, Windows had 95 percent market share -- people did not think it was worth putting a price on it. So I was a little depressed. And then I heard Al Gore's talk, and I realized I didn't know the meaning of depressed. (Laughter) But it turns out I was wrong, right? Because the iPod came out, and it violated every bit of common wisdom. Other products cost less; other products had more features, they had voice recorders and FM transmitters. The other products were backed by Microsoft, with an open standard, not Apple's propriety standard. But the iPod won -- this is the one they wanted. The lesson was: simplicity sells. And there are signs that the industry is getting the message. This is a little company that's done very well with simplicity and elegance. The Sonos thing -- it's catching on. I've got just a couple examples. Physically, a really cool, elegant thinking coming along lately. When you have a digital camera, how do you get the pictures back to your computer? Well, you either haul around a USB cable, or you buy a card reader and haul that around. Either one, you're going to lose. What I do is, I take out the memory card, and I fold it in half, revealing USB contacts. I just stick it in the computer, offload the pictures, put it right back in the camera. I never have to lose anything. Here's another example. Chris, you're the source of all power. Will you be my power plug? Chris Anderson: Oh yeah. DP: Hold that and don't let go. You might've seen this, this is Apple's new laptop. This the power cord. It hooks on like this. And I'm sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives, or one of your children. You walk along -- and I'm about to pull this onto the floor. I don't care. It's a loaner. Here we go. Whoa! It's magnetic -- it doesn't pull the laptop onto the floor. (Applause) In my very last example -- I do a lot of my work using speech recognition software. And I'll just -- you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous. Speech recognition software is really great for doing emails very quickly; period. Like, I get hundreds of them a day; period. And it's not just what I dictate that it writes down; period. I also use this feature called voice macros; period. Correct 'dissuade.' Not 'just.' Ok, this is not an ideal situation, because it's getting the echo from the hall and stuff. The point is, I can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word, and having it write out a much longer thing. So if somebody sends me a fan letter, I'll say, 'Thanks for that.' [Thank you so much for taking the time to write ...] (Laughter) (Applause) And conversely, if somebody sends me hate mail -- which happens daily -- I say, 'Piss off.' (Laughter) [I admire your frankness ...] (Laughter) (Applause) So that's my dirty little secret. Don't tell anyone. (Laughter) So the point is -- this is a really interesting story. This is version eight of this software, and do you know what they put in version eight? No new features. It's never happened before in software! The company put no new features. They just said, 'We'll make this software work right.' Right? Because for years, people had bought this software, tried it out -- 95 percent accuracy was all they got, which means one in 20 words is wrong -- and they'd put it in their drawer. And the company got sick of that, so they said, 'This version, we're not going to do anything, but make sure it's darned accurate.' And so that's what they did. This cult of doing things right is starting to spread. So, my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology: remember, if it doesn't work, it's not necessarily you, ok? It could be the design of the thing you're using. Be aware in life of good design and bad design. And if you're among the people who create this stuff: Easy is hard. Pre-sweat the details for your audience. Count the taps. Remember, the hard part is not deciding what features to add, it's deciding what to leave out. And best of all, your motivation is: simplicity sells. CA: Bravo. DP: Thank you very much. CA: Hear, hear! (Applause)</td>\n",

I have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night. And I say that sincerely, partly because (Mock sob) I need that. (Laughter) Put yourselves in my position. (Laughter) I flew on Air Force Two for eight years. (Laughter) Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane! (Laughter) (Applause) I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me. (Laughter) It's a true story -- every bit of this is true. Soon after Tipper and I left the -- (Mock sob) White House -- (Laughter) we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville. Driving ourselves. (Laughter) I know it sounds like a little thing to you, but -- (Laughter) I looked in the rear-view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me. There was no motorcade back there. (Laughter) You've heard of phantom limb pain? (Laughter) This was a rented Ford Taurus. (Laughter) It was dinnertime, and we started looking for a place to eat. We were on I-40. We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee. We got off the exit, we found a Shoney's restaurant. Low-cost family restaurant chain, for those of you who don't know it. We went in and sat down at the booth, and the waitress came over, made a big commotion over Tipper. (Laughter) She took our order, and then went to the couple in the booth next to us, and she lowered her voice so much, I had to really strain to hear what she was saying. And she said 'Yes, that's former Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper.' And the man said, 'He's come down a long way, hasn't he?' (Laughter) (Applause) There's been kind of a series of epiphanies. (Laughter) The very next day, continuing the totally true story, I got on a G-V to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria, in the city of Lagos, on the topic of energy. And I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville. And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you: Tipper and I were driving ourselves, Shoney's, low-cost family restaurant chain, what the man said -- they laughed. I gave my speech, then went back out to the airport to fly back home. I fell asleep on the plane until, during the middle of the night, we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling. I woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air, and I looked, and there was a man running across the runway. And he was waving a piece of paper, and he was yelling, 'Call Washington! Call Washington!' And I thought to myself, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be wrong in Washington? Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things. (Laughter) But what it turned out to be, was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech, and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America. It was printed in Monterey, I checked. (Laughter) And the story began, 'Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday,' quote: 'My wife Tipper and I have opened a low-cost family restaurant'' -- (Laughter) ''named Shoney's, and we are running it ourselves.'' (Laughter) Before I could get back to U.S. soil, David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on -- one of them had me in a big white chef's hat, Tipper was saying, 'One more burger with fries!' (Laughter) Three days later, I got a nice, long, handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton, saying, 'Congratulations on the new restaurant, Al!' (Laughter) We like to celebrate each other's successes in life. (Laughter) I was going to talk about information ecology. But I was thinking that, since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED, that maybe I could talk about that another time. (Applause) Chris Anderson: It's a deal! (Applause) Al Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on: What can you do about the climate crisis? I want to start with a couple of -- I'm going to show some new images, and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five. Now, the slide show. I update the slide show every time I give it. I add new images, because I learn more about it every time I give it. It's like beach-combing, you know? Every time the tide comes in and out, you find some more shells. Just in the last two days, we got the new temperature records in January. This is just for the United States of America. Historical average for Januarys is 31 degrees; last month was 39.5 degrees. Now, I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment -- I'm kidding. But these are the recapitulation slides, and then I'm going to go into new material about what you can do. But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these. First of all, this is where we're projected to go with the U.S. contribution to global warming, under business as usual. Efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit. Efficiency and conservation -- it's not a cost; it's a profit. The sign is wrong. It's not negative; it's positive. These are investments that pay for themselves. But they are also very effective in deflecting our path. Cars and trucks -- I talked about that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective. It's an easy, visible target of concern -- and it should be -- but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest standards in the world. And so we should address that. But it's part of the puzzle. Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks. Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference. And with what Vinod, and John Doerr and others, many of you here -- there are a lot of people directly involved in this -- this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it. Carbon Capture and Sequestration -- that's what CCS stands for -- is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe. Not quite there yet. OK. Now, what can you do? Reduce emissions in your home. Most of these expenditures are also profitable. Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid. Use light rail. Figure out some of the other options that are much better. It's important. Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy, between things that have a harsh effect, or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis. Consider this: Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life. Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people. It is easier than you think. It really is. A lot of us in here have made that decision, and it is really pretty easy. It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make, and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced. And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net. There is a carbon calculator. Participant Productions convened -- with my active involvement -- the leading software writers in the world, on this arcane science of carbon calculation, to construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculator. You can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce. And by the time the movie comes out in May, this will be updated to 2.0, and we will have click-through purchases of offsets. Next, consider making your business carbon-neutral. Again, some of us have done that, and it's not as hard as you think. Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology, or entertainment, or design and architecture community. Invest sustainably. Majora mentioned this. Listen, if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance, don't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management. Over time, people do what you pay them to do. And if they judge how much they're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested, based on the short-term returns, you're going to get short-term decisions. A lot more to be said about that. Become a catalyst of change. Teach others, learn about it, talk about it. The movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertaining. And it comes out in May. Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it. Consider sending somebody to Nashville. Pick well. And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow -- re-purposed, with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and it's not just the slides, it's what they mean. And it's how they link together. And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge. Working with Larry Lessig, it will be, somewhere in that process, posted with tools and limited-use copyrights, so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way. (Applause) Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm's length from politics? It doesn't mean that if you're a Republican, that I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat. We need Republicans as well. This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that in this group it really is. Become politically active. Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work. Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions -- global warming pollution -- and trading it. Here's why: as long as the United States is out of the world system, it's not a closed system. Once it becomes a closed system, with U.S. participation, then everybody who's on a board of directors -- how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation? Once it's a closed system, you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided. The market will work to solve this problem -- if we can accomplish this. Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring. We have to change the minds of the American people. Because presently, the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done. And in our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did. It's now repetition of short, hot-button, 30-second, 28-second television ads. We have to buy a lot of those ads. Let's re-brand global warming, as many of you have suggested. I like 'climate crisis' instead of 'climate collapse,' but again, those of you who are good at branding, I need your help on this. Somebody said the test we're facing now, a scientist told me, is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination. (Laughter) That's really true. I said the other night, and I'll repeat now: this is not a political issue. Again, the Republicans here -- this shouldn't be partisan. You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do. This is an opportunity. Not just this, but connected to the ideas that are here, to bring more coherence to them. We are one. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. (Applause)</td>\n",

                                                                                            Hello, I am Machine Dazzle, and I am an emotionally-driven, instinct-based conceptual artist, designer and musician. Today I'm going to talk about the power of transformation through the sacred ritual of costume. With the help of my friend Matty Crosland. Matty? Oh, hey, girl. (Laughs) Matty is going to hand out a few seeds of possibility while I continue. Growing up in Middle America, I wasn't allowed to be who I was. I was discouraged from a career in the arts. When we went to the toy store, my two brothers would run to the black and blue aisle and I would run to the pink aisle. There was a lot of shame surrounding my preference for 'girls'' toys. I shoplifted my first Barbie. Desperate people do desperate things. But what was really happening during that time is I was building up a massive reserve of ideas, unrealized desires and dreams. And when I bought that one-way ticket to New York, which is the first decision I ever truly made for myself, I brought with me that reserve of unrealized dreams, desires and ideas. And that's when I really started to take risks. And I learned about the power of transformation, starting with becoming my true self. In 2019, I was commissioned by Guggenheim Works and Process to do a show. I knew immediately that I wanted to make a show about my mother, Deborah. Here she is, printed on my dress. It was the '60s, the bouffant, the cat-eye frames. Maybe some of you remember. Sadly, I lost my mother in 1996 to cancer. So in her honor, I created a rock and roll cabaret. It features songs that I wrote and sang about her, my relationship with her and my self-actualization. It is called 'Treasure,' and you can listen to it on your favorite streaming service. In fact, I just released the first dance track from it. It's called 'Understand,' and if you like to wiggle your peach, then you should look it up. (Laughter) My opening outfit, I created this big '60s bouffant. It is made out of about 2,500 metallic pipe cleaners. Why pipe cleaners? Because wigs are common. And I like to challenge existing systems and take risks. And it is actually quite heavy. Transformation takes commitment. Did I mention that my work is maximal? We are complex beings. We exist in many layers. Speaking of layers, then I added this swing coat. It's made out of an old American flag camouflaged in paint, dye and adorned with flowers. Flowers that I found in the dumpster at the cemetery where my mother's ashes are buried. Yes, people take fake flowers off of the graves, throw them into the dumpster to put new fake flowers on the graves. I thought it was appropriate. And so there it is, a source of protection. On stage, I became not my mother, that wasn't the point. I became a higher version of myself. Not man, not woman. Something other. In this show, I'm hoping to realize all of my dreams and not just mine, but all of my mother's, too, because she had them. More is more. One of my -- yes, I wish you could all have them, but you know how it is. (Laughter) Pom pom on head, look at that. One of my most maximal projects to date is with my favorite collaborator, Taylor Mac. Together with hundreds of others, we created a 24-hour show. It is called '24 Decades: A History of Popular Music.' It premiered in Brooklyn at St. Ann’s Warehouse in 2016. It's a 24-hour show. It starts in 1776 and goes to the present day. Every hour of the show is dedicated to a different decade in American history. For every decade, I created a costume that is conceptually adjacent, not historically accurate. Why? Because traditional historical costume already exists, conceptually and otherwise. And I like to break traditions and invent new ones. And when you break an egg, there are countless ways to turn it into something delicious. So it’s high noon in Brooklyn at St. Ann’s Warehouse. It's the top of the show in 1776, right after we freed ourselves from the British in the United States. And inspiration came when I was walking in Brooklyn, where I live. I was passing this laundromat. What were they doing? They were taking down these old, plastic, grand-opening flags. What were they doing? They were putting up new plastic, grand-opening flags. Well, I snatched them out of the garbage because, you know, and I noticed how weather-worn and brittle and fragile they were. And I got to thinking about the end of the American Revolution and how tattered and torn and broken everything must have been. And then it hit me. This costume wants to tell a story. An illegitimate child of colonialism ran away from home to New Orleans and opened the laundromat called Lou Washery, and they are celebrating the Grand Overture as the official, unofficial cheerleader of the original 13 colonies. This is maximalism. Not only is it layer upon layer aesthetically, it's idea on top of idea conceptually. It becomes its own story, almost that you can almost read like a book. Well, if history has taught us anything, it's that things change. Here we are an hour later in the show, and it's time for a costume change. An apple pie as a headdress. The care and the craft and the smell of home. And I put two pipes on Taylor's back, upholstered in a colonial fabric, steam was coming out of them at the top of that decade. But you know how it is. And they represent the invention of the steam engine, which gave way to westward expansion, for better or for worse. And then I thought, well, what else was happening? Well, George Washington was president at the time, and I was always kind of into his little cherry tree story of virtue. You know, 'I cannot tell a lie, I chopped down that cherry tree.' And it was the French Revolution across the pond and the guillotine was like, full on. So I was like, 'Well, why don't I combine them together?' And, oh, you know, severed heads in cherry tree drag as garment. What I'm getting at is, the costume can be so much more than the costume. It can be the props, it can be the set, it can tell its own stories, it can even be its own character. It can be all of it at the same time. This kind of maximalism leaves an audience completely satisfied, yet wanting more at the same time. More is more. Well, wouldn’t you know, now it’s 7pm at night, and it's time for the Civil War. I took two distinct inventions from this time to help tell this story. I read somewhere once that the American hot dog evolved out of German immigrants selling their bratwurst and rolls on the streets during the 1860s. Well, I like that. And then this distinctive barbed wire, you know, barbed wire, a symbol of separation, security, insecurity. Well, I wanted to combine the two together. In this way of making things, I bring order to disorder. By turning barbed wire into hot dogs, what I'm trying to do, hopefully, is eat through what is separating us, in this case, slavery. When you believe in something that is marginalized and goes against the mainstream of society, it is so important that you do it big, bold, brave and unapologetically, truly. OK, well, here we are after the war again. It’s time for Reconstruction. And, you know, how about the invention of the typewriter? I love the way this piece wiggles as Taylor clicks across the stage. And then the introduction of dynamite and toilet paper on rolls, how domestic! Well, I took those empty toilet paper rolls, and I painted them to look like sticks of dynamite and boom -- headdress, hello. You know, why not? Well, here we are. Now, we've been performing all night. We're tired. It’s 10am. It's the 1980s. Just in time for the AIDS pandemic. Taylor wears two white, high-heeled shoes sprinkled with little green pom poms. They look like clown shoes, but they represent the white blood cells being attacked by HIV. This collaboration, this '24-Decade History of Popular Music,' took maximalism and 'more is more' to a whole new level. I have to say, through the music, the storytelling and the transformative nature of the costumes, we changed the course of queer history. And if nothing else, it sure is fun to pull an all-nighter with 24 costume changes. Well, here we are. This is an image of me on the streets of New York City at the Easter Bonnet Parade several years ago. I am a fan of taking my art to the streets. But I have to tell you, it takes a little bit of courage to dress like this in public, particularly these days. Just about every part of my creative ethos is under attack in the United States right now. On first glance, you might see an over-the-top outfit on a Sunday, in black and white and pink. But upon closer inspection, you'll see the details, the skull peeking out, the skeletal hand creeping out of the innocent plush animals on my head. I once had my Easter bonnet ripped right off of my head in front of St. Patrick's Cathedral. Not this one. I don't think they would dare. Sometimes, I think that life is about overcoming all of your greatest fears. Life itself is how you go about that. I go all the way. I do the work. There is no happiness that I know unless I am risking something. The only true happiness that I know comes from this sense of accomplishment, by taking the risk. Well, here I am again on the streets of New York, this time for the Reclaim Pride March back in 2019 again. A good friend gave me really good advice once. 'Machine, it's never too early to be pre-revolutionary, and it's never too late to be post-apocalyptic chic.' (Laughter) Sometimes this course of action, this transformation, is the most honest action that you can take. You owe yourself honesty. I consider it a prayer. Today, after all, is a placeholder for what's coming tomorrow. By becoming other, you avoid labels. You can change someone's life just by walking across the room because you are changing what is possible in their minds. Be more. You will get more out of life. And not just for you, for everyone around you. I'm telling you, that is the Gospel truth. Another thing I wanted to say, this collective land of make-believe that we are in right now, this is very fertile, very creative space where anything is possible. Matty, let's bring it home. (Music: 'Miss Object of Desire' by Machine Dazzle) Mother, I want to be Miss Object of Desire A walking dream, a Phoenix lips of fire Strange reflection in the perfumed air Changing faces till she settles where a memory vibrates Liberation (Applause) (Music continues) Broken glass and my dress is torn Screaming in silence Thank you. (Laughs) (Music continues) (Applause) Mother, I want to be Miss Object of desire A walking dream, a Phoenix lips of fire  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Can you paint with all the colors of the wind? I love this song from the first time I heard it. I was 14, growing up in public housing in western Sydney. So maybe a little too old for this Disney classic from 'Pocahontas.' But it spoke to me. I saw something of myself in it. At this stage, I think I knew I was queer. I mean, come on, I was rocking out to Disney. (Laughter) And look at those glasses. (Laughter) Seriously, what a queer kid. (Laughter) But I was also from a Pacific Indigenous heritage with conservative views and values. I didn't feel like I could fit into any of the boxes that were being presented to me. Straight, gay, Fijian, Australian. I couldn't pick just one color to paint with. Prior to colonization, sexuality amongst many of our Pacific islands across the region was fluid. Men would have sex with men without the stigma or shame afforded it today. Sexual intimacy was a way of being able to connect socially and relationally. Sex wasn't just for procreation. Or in marriage. It wasn't exclusively monogamous. Just because you had sex with a man didn't define your sexuality. It didn't make you an outcast. But as Europeans started to colonize the Pacific region, they brought Christian missionaries with them. They told us to cover up our beautiful bodies. We were taught shame. We were told to stop practicing Pacifica cultures and values that were seen as provocative. To a Western and white perspective, our non-binary sexuality was judged as tribal, outdated, sinful and impossible to practice alongside a Christian faith. Still today, those who are Indigenous to the Pacific are negatively impacted by whiteness. That “white is right, West is best.” I was brought up to espouse strong Christian beliefs, views and values which would shape my burgeoning identity as an adult. From these staunch conservative views, I was taught to fear the queer. Those people that were seen as unusual and fruity. And in essence, I grew to despise a part of myself. I sought to separate my queerness from my identity. I could never see myself as part of that world. Growing up, biracial and bisexual constantly challenged the way I saw the world around me. I was unsure about my thinking, feelings and behaviors around liking males and females. I was unsure about my thinking, feelings and behaviors when it came to whether I needed to be a white Australian or a Fijian person. And whether this needed to be framed within a binary to choose one over the other. In this way, I don't think that my story is unique. There's plenty of people in the queer world that have escaped conservative upbringings, religions and cultures. But this is only part of my story. Another common story in the queer community is the coming-out story. When did you tell your parents? How did they react? How it liberated you or ultimately separated you from your family. But this didn't feel like an option for me either. I believe that embedded in these particular stories, these tropes, is a part of dominant queer culture that made it very hard for me to access the queer world. For example, when I started to go to gay clubs, I would be lining up at the front of the club and often I would get door staff come up to me and go, 'Sorry, you do know this is a gay club, right?' From these lived experiences, I feel that there is a whiteness that pervades queer culture. And I didn't want to give up my identity and my appearance as a Pacific indigenous person to be queer. Pacifica cultures really, really value and esteem the collective above the individual. For Pacifica people, our families are inextricably connected to our own sense of self-agency, self-determination, self-esteem, self-love and self-worth. Our own individual identities are meshed and intertwined with our family's reputation and standing in the community. Our mind, body and souls are inextricably connected to the broader community, to our families, to ourselves and to others. I didn't want to come out to potentially ostracize myself, to make a point to separate myself from my Pacific and faith communities. I couldn't then see my authentic self in any of these spaces. And a quick shout out to my son on the left-hand side. Round of applause for my son. (Laughs) (Applause) He said to me this morning, 'Daddy, make sure you mention me.' So I was like, 'OK, son. Alright.' So there you go for the recording, son. And the rest are my other family, that's up there as well. Across queer cultures and the broader community, we have learned to embrace our gender and sexual differences. We encourage individuals to be allies for each other and to support safe spaces for those that are seen to not fit in. We empower and really encourage individuals to really develop and express their self-agency, their self-determination, their self love, their self-worth. We boldly go into spaces striving to bring others with us to ensure that we can create inclusive societies for everyone. However, the dominant Western view in queer cultures is still based on the individual. Me, myself and I. And my individual pursuits towards happiness. As a queer Indigenous Pacific person, I feel that there are parts of queer culture that is white, feels very white. We may fail to see the importance of bringing our families and our cultural communities along our journey as queer people. It's either the queer way or the highway. It's one or the other. Young or old. Rich or poor. Smart or stupid. Masculine or feminine. Fit or fat. These binaries create a sense of us and them, those people. A binary approach and position that we generally in Western white societies use to determine the norm. We create, conflate, perpetuate binaries that create divisions in our society. Saints or sinner, straight or gay. I see it like this. Binaries are a very white and Western way of thinking, feeling and behaving. As individuals today, we live within these binaries and create identities that then create these labels. We use these labels to then define and confine people and places. We are one or the other. But what we fail to see is that our identities are more than a set of binaries. Our own identities are comprised of intersecting identifiers that contributes to who you are, including our age, class, color, education, gender, size, spirituality, sexuality, and so, so much more. We need to decolonize queerness, to live beyond “white is right, West is best.” Because if we don't, we're going to continue to create silos and divisions in our societies that don't create inclusive and safe spaces for everyone. For Indigenous queer people, they shape our connection to community and culture, our families. If we don't include that within our understanding of who we are, even as queer people, then we're not able to be, again, our true and authentic selves. We're not able to then be our fabulous selves as part of the queer community. And it's really, really interesting because I believe that we can learn so much from pre-colonial cultures like those that were practiced in the Pacific, that provide a different way of looking at a society. A queer way that pre-dates all the privileges that go into binary ways of thinking, feeling and behaving. Across many of our Pacifica languages we have a lot of key concepts that help solidify and support a shared understanding of the collective. For example, in Fijian, 'solesolevaki' is all about reciprocal living, where my wellbeing is your wellbeing. I will actively seek to ensure that your well-being and every part of your life is catered for, knowing that you will do the same for me. We strive to enact “veiqaravi,” as tatted here on my hand, to serve others. We strive to also embed and embold and empower people to practice 'veirokovi,' respect for self and others where we are relationally driven, where that is so important to our spaces and places. My sense of ability to actually put this into practice, my ability to actually understand these Indigenous perspectives has greatly helped shape and reconcile my queer identity today. But what's really interesting is that it's not just queer communities that need to decolonize itself. It's all of us as a broader society that needs to be part of a shared conversation to decolonize, deconstruct and disrupt binary ways of thinking, feeling and behaving. So how can we practically do that? Practice cultural humility, where you are constantly learning and embracing differences, where you get over yourselves and strive to learn about other people's differences and how that can be meaningfully included in the way in which you create safe spaces for everyone. I also believe it's possible to bring Indigenous perspectives into Western and white workplaces. For example, I’ve introduced the concept of “talanoa” in all of my work meetings. Talanoa is all about being able to create a safe space where everyone is able to contribute to a collective, collegial and collaborative conversation. Where people are able to bring their authentic selves into these spaces. Literally, I will chair meetings where I have no firm set agenda items and I literally would just hold space for participants just to bring themselves. So you can tell I'm a social worker, right? (Laughter) Safe space, safe space, safe space. It's OK, it's OK. But it's through these safe spaces that people can bring their multiple, intersecting identifiers, including their age, their class, color, education, gender, size, spirituality, sexuality and so, so much more. I invite queer communities to come talanoa with Pacific Indigenous Communities to create robust and resilient queer cultures. I have been able to greatly reconcile my queer and Pacifica identities, which has now really been embraced to help shape how I see the world around me today. And it's through these shared perspectives and approaches that we can truly embrace cultural diversity and its differences. And to know that people can live beyond those binaries and those labels we continue to perpetuate and perpetrate against others. It is a commitment from queer communities to decolonize queerness. It's a commitment from me, from you and all of us to decolonize Western and white societies and to live beyond the binary way of thinking, feeling and behaving. I genuinely believe that it's through this common goal that we can truly learn how to paint with all the colors of the wind. “Vinaka vakalevu” and thank you.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I spent my whole career in the nonprofit sector. Street outreach, program management, fundraising, grant making, public policy, you name it, I've done it. I've seen a lot. And I'm a really positive person, so it's actually difficult to say this. But the way we do philanthropy right now, the way we've done it for decades, is broken. And here's how I found out. In my early 20s, I was a frontline social worker in New York City, working with people living with HIV. Many of them had multiple chronic illnesses, and they were underhoused. So I'd spend my days, and even some nights, with them, running around the city to doctor's appointments and housing agencies. The day-to-day work was hard. But the hardest part was we never had had enough funding to do the work. On Friday mornings, I'd go into the office to write up my case notes for the week and I'd speed past front reception, not looking at the mailboxes full of blue slips. Each blue letter marked another colleague let go because of our funding crisis. Within one month, I’d lost half my team, and my caseload ballooned from 30 to over 100. And this is the reality for so many nonprofits. They're at the mercy of their funders. And when we look at those funders, they decide who and what gets funded. And it's almost always a mystery how they make those decisions. Nonprofits spend so much time fundraising, filling out pages and pages and pages of paperwork. And they're filling out so much paperwork that they hardly have any time to actually support communities, which is literally the thing that they're funded to do. After years of doing amazing work, improving every single metric, we'd hear things like, 'I'm sorry, our major donor has switched direction. They’re no longer working and investing in HIV and AIDS.” Or, “I’m sorry, we issue grants for three years max.' This would never happen in the private sector. You do an amazing job for three years and then get fired? It makes no sense. So I decided to switch sides. Instead of being on the side that's asking for money, what if I went to the side that was giving money? Help them understand what was happening on the ground and make a change. So off I went into the world of philanthropy only to discover that trillions of dollars are in donor-advised funds and private foundations just waiting to be donated. Meanwhile, those nonprofits and community-led organizations are wasting so much time filling out paperwork and competing over scraps. I'd hear a donor publicly support a cause like homelessness. And then behind closed doors, I'd hear, 'They don't really know what's good for them. What they really need is ...' Which is code for “donor knows best.” I was confused. How could a donor possibly know what was really needed? Their lifestyle look nothing like the people they wanted to help. The problem wasn't a lack of money. Again, trillions of dollars are sitting just waiting to be put to work. But even if we unlocked every single one of those dollars, it actually wouldn't matter because a very small group of people are making all of the decisions about funding. Their priorities, their way. Almost 70 percent of donations are directed by the top one percent of donors. And they choose causes that resonate with their lives, like their university or the arts. And these issues are overfunded. And look, I know that donors have good intentions. I really do. But good intentions are not good enough. Communities are being left behind, and we are running out of time. I wanted to shift the power dynamic from a top-down approach to a community-led model, where nonprofits and donors really work together. So in 2020, I co-founded the Foundation for Black Communities with Liban Abokor, Djaka Blais-Amare and Joseph Smith, to do exactly that. We were inspired by a radically different type of philanthropy, Black philanthropy. It's the formal and informal giving that happens in Black communities around the world. In some cases, it's the kind of giving that you don't get a tax receipt for. And I learned this mostly in my family. We do almost everything together, including box hand. Box hand is an informal savings group, and in my family we have 13 members. So twice a month we all throw a hand, meaning we put 100 dollars into the pot and one person gets the entire thing, 1,300 dollars. The person who gets the full amount rotates, and you'll get the full thing two times a year. It's helped my family buy a new fridge, pay school tuition, and you know what, we've even put a down payment on a house using this. And sometimes we negotiate. 'Oh, you need your hand ahead of me? No problem, I'll wait.' Of the 13 people, some really need it. It's their only means of savings. And others would be fine without it. But here, we're all equal. There is no top or bottom. It's not about charity or pity or sympathy. The goal of box hand is that everybody levels up. And it’s easier to level up together because we're accountable to the collective. This practice has existed across the African diaspora since the 1700s. In Guyana, we call it box hand. In Nigeria, its “susu.” In Mali and Senegal it’s “tontines.” In Haiti, it’s called “sol.” And in Jamaica, it’s “partner.” And the cool thing is this exists outside of the African diaspora, too. It looks slightly different from place to place. The Haida nation has potlatches, in Mexico, there's 'tandas' and in Cambodia, there's 'tontine.' And communities turn to each other and use this kind of collective approach when we face exclusion and systemic racism in the financial industry. For example, Black people are rejected business loans and mortgages at twice the rate of the general population. And so when we face that exclusion, we turn to our communities and are creative in our solution-making. And, you know, this has been passed down from generation to generation. My mother taught me this. She gives generously to our communities because they gave generously to her. Now and forever, the collective giving never stops. Black philanthropy is rooted in a concept called Ubuntu. It's an African philosophy widely understood as humanity towards others. And we have a saying: “I am because you are.” Or 'I am because we are.' And that means, what affects you affects me. We're all interconnected and have a shared responsibility to one another. Ubuntu would be the guiding principle for the Foundation for Black Communities. And in order to do that, we need to make two practical shifts. Who is making funding decisions, and how those decisions are made? So the who is obvious. We're looking at Black community members, but we're looking for true, on-the-ground experts. And this is an important distinction. Some people will say to me, 'Rebecca, you're Black. Tell us what's best for Black communities,' which is actually ridiculous. How could I possibly speak on behalf of all Black people? You can't, it's not possible. So to have real insight, we’d look for local experts and let them make the decisions. Because they know their communities, their partners and field the best. And this is what we did in our recent, 500,000-dollar youth wellness granting program. We received 99 eligible applications from Black groups working in everything from diabetes awareness to inner-city farming and after school programming. And just like box hand, we turn to the collective and extended an invitation to be part of our grant review panel. Now, the invitation was intentionally put to anybody connected to the project. It might be a program manager, a participant or a volunteer. And those volunteers became peer reviewers. The peer reviewers read each application, scored them and offered candid feedback. And then we used their rankings to allocate funding. In other words, it was the collective that made the funding decision. Now, you might be thinking, 'What's the big deal about that?' But after years in philanthropy, I can tell you, that's not how it's typically done. It's usually the donor, maybe their relative or a CEO who has the final say. But here, we trusted community to do the work and to make those funding decisions. Luckily, we're not the first or only to pool funding and trust community to make decisions. We're part of a growing movement that's changing the power dynamics in philanthropy. And recently, because of our community-led approach and collective advocacy, the Canadian government awarded the Foundation for Black Communities a historic 200 million dollars. (Cheers and applause) This is amazing. And I'm hopeful that private foundations and donors will follow this powerful example. You know, there are hundreds of community-led collaboratives working in the most pressing issues of our times. For example, there’s Right Relations Collaborative, and Indigenous peoples are making the decisions there. At the Equality Fund, feminists are making the decisions. And at CLIMA Fund, climate activists are making the decisions. When I think back on my time in the front lines, I wonder, if different people were making the funding decisions would those blue slips even have existed? Because the funding was always available. It just wasn't accessible to the communities who need it most. And this is finally changing with community-led collaborative funds. Even after all of my time in the sector, the highs and lows, I'm optimistic, because the future of philanthropy is happening right now, where community-led collaboratives are the bridge between people who want to do good with their money and the people on the ground with the experience to do it. This is Ubuntu. We are all interconnected, and each of us has a role to play. I am because you are. I am because we are. Thank you. (Applause and cheers)  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                             For 100 days in 1994, the African country of Rwanda suffered a horrific campaign of mass murder. Neighbor turned against neighbor as violence engulfed the region, resulting in the deaths of over one-tenth of the country’s population. The seeds of this conflict were planted a century earlier, first when German, and later Belgian, colonizers arrived in the country. At the time, Rwanda was ruled by a monarchy of Tutsi, one of the three ethnic groups comprising the population. Tutsi and the even smaller Twa communities were minority groups, while Hutu composed the majority. Many Hutus and Tutsi civilians were on good terms, but colonial powers encouraged political division. Belgians enforced record keeping around ethnic identity, and created a public narrative that cast Tutsi as elite rulers and Hutu as ordinary farmers. Over time, this propaganda led  to intense political hostility. And while colonial powers had largely withdrawn by 1959, lingering anger motivated a Hutu revolt, forcing many Tutsi leaders to flee the country. Over the following decade, Rwanda transitioned to an independent republic with a Hutu government. This new administration argued that as the majority group, Hutu deserved exclusive access to political power. They excluded the Tutsi minority  by appointing offices based on population and prohibited the return of Tutsi families that had fled years earlier. Hutu extremists also circulated propaganda blaming Tutsi for the country’s economic, social, and political problems. Discontent with their life in exile, a small group of Tutsi insurgents invaded Rwanda in 1990, beginning a violent civil war. The conflict lasted three years before it was resolved with a formal peace accord. But the war’s aftermath was rife with insecurity. While some civilians in both groups remained amicable, the treaty intensified political polarization. And in 1994, when a plane carrying the Hutu Rwandan president was shot down, the conflict broke out anew. This time, Hutu officials had prepared a deadly response to ensure they stayed in power. Working off a list of targets, government-funded Hutu militias flooded the streets, perpetrating acts of physical and sexual violence against Tutsi political enemies and civilians. Over the chaotic following months, over 1 million Hutu civilians joined their ranks due to coercion, self-preservation, or the pursuit of personal agendas. Tutsi victims sought refuge at churches and schools where they hoped international organizations would protect them, but no outside party came to their aid. UN soldiers who’d overseen the Peace Accord were instructed to abandon Tutsi civilians, and UN leadership refused to acknowledge the genocide taking place. The violence didn’t end until mid-July, when the Tutsi army— who instigated the previous civil war— seized control of the country. By the time the fighting was over, roughly 800,000 Rwandans had been killed, and only a small fraction of the Tutsi population was left alive. In the months that followed, there was no easy strategy for bringing the killers to justice. The UN established a special tribunal in Tanzania to try the key perpetrators. But Hutu civilians from every level of society had committed atrocities against their neighbors, friends, and even family members. There were roughly 120,000 Rwandans awaiting trial, and inmates were dying from overcrowding and poor hygiene. The new Rwandan government estimated  it would take 100 years to prosecute every accused civilian in national court. So officials determined  the best path forward involved looking to the country’s past. Rwanda has a traditional process for resolving interpersonal conflicts called gacaca. Roughly translating to “justice on the grass,” gacaca had long been used to address offenses within villages. Local witnesses would offer testimony and could then speak for or against the accused. Then, appointed lay judges would determine an appropriate penalty within the community’s means. In the hope of trying perpetrators more quickly, the government adapted gacaca for their formal courts. These hybrid trials had  no professional attorneys or judges, and no evidence outside the spoken word and a case file detailing the crimes of the accused. All charges were then divided into four categories: masterminding the genocide and committing acts of sexual violence, participating in the killings, physical assault, or destroying Tutsi property. Those found guilty of the first two categories were entered into the traditional court system, but the other crimes were assigned set penalties which could be reduced if the accused pled guilty. Beginning in 2002, thousands of gacaca courts convened every week. The process proved faster  than conventional courts, but Rwandan opinion on the trials was mixed. Some didn’t want to accuse their neighbors in a community setting, and many potential witnesses were intimidated to prevent their testimony. Additionally, while the trial showed that not all Hutu participated in the killings, the courts only reviewed cases with Tutsi victims, ignoring the Hutu casualties incurred during the genocide and the preceding civil war. When the trials concluded in 2012, the courts had convicted 1.7 million individuals. For some families, these verdicts  helped restore the dignity of those lost in the violence. For others, the trials were a decade-long reminder of a past they were desperate to leave behind.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I became obsessed with the relationship between the brain and the mind after suffering a series of concussions playing football and rugby in college. I felt my mind change for years after. I was studying computers at the time, and it felt as though I had damaged my hardware and that my software was running differently. Over the following years, a close friend suffered a serious neck injury and multiple friends and family members were struggling with crippling mental health issues. All around me, people that I loved dearly were being afflicted by ailments of the nervous system or the mind. I was grappling with all of this while pursuing an MFA in Design and Technology at Parsons when a friend and fellow student showed me an open-source tutorial on how to build a low-cost single-channel EEG system to detect brain activity. After a couple long nights of hacking and tinkering, I saw my brainwaves dancing across the screen for the very first time. And that moment changed my life. In that moment, I felt as though I had the possibility to help myself and the people I loved. And I also realized that I couldn't do it alone. I needed help. So in 2013, in Brooklyn, with some like-minded friends, I started OpenBCI, an open-source neurotechnology company. In the beginning, our goal was to build an inward-pointing telescope and to share the blueprints with the world so that anybody with a computer could begin peering into their own brain. At first, we were an EEG-only company. We sold brain sensors to measure brain activity. I thought that's what people wanted. But over time, we discovered people doing very strange things with our technology. Some people were connecting the equipment to the stomach to measure the neurons in the gut and study gut-brain connection and the microbiome. Others were using the tools to build new muscle sensors and controllers for prosthetics and robotics. And some were designing new devices and peripheral add-ons that could be connected to the platform to measure new types of data that I had never heard of before. What we learned from all of this is that the brain by itself is actually quite boring. Turns out brain data alone lacks context. And what we ultimately care about is not the brain, but the mind, consciousness, human cognition. When we have things like EMG sensors to measure muscle activity or ECG sensors to measure heart activity, eye trackers and even environmental sensors to measure the world around us, all of this makes the brain data much more useful. But the organs around our body, our sensory receptors, are actually much easier to collect data from than the brain, and also arguably much more important for determining the things that we actually care about: emotions, intentions and the mind overall. Additionally, we realized that people weren't just interested in reading from the brain and the body. They were also interested in modulating the mind through various types of sensory stimulation. Things like light, sound, haptics and electricity. It's one thing to record the mind, it's another to modulate it. The idea of a combined system that can both read from and write to the brain or body is referred to as a closed-loop system or bidirectional human interface. This concept is truly profound, and it will define the next major revolution in computing technology. When you have products that not just are designed for the average user but are designed to actually adapt to their user, that's something truly special. When we know what the data of an emotion or a feeling looks like and we know how to make that data go up or down, then using AI, we can build constructive or destructive interference patterns to either amplify or suppress those emotions or feelings. In the very near future, we will have computers that we are resonantly and subconsciously connected to, enabling empathetic computing for the very first time. In 2018, we put these learnings to work and began development of a new tool for cognitive exploration. Named after my friend Gael, who passed from ALS in 2016, we call it Galea. It’s a multimodal bio-sensing headset, and it is absolutely packed with sensors. It can measure the user’s heart, skin, muscles, eyes and brain, and it combines that capability with head-mounted displays or augmented and virtual reality headsets. Additionally, we're exploring the integration of non-invasive electrical neural stimulation as a feature. The Galea software suite can turn the raw sensor data into meaningful metrics. With some of the sensors, we're able to provide new forms of real-time interactivity and control. And with all of the sensors, we're able to make quantifiable inferences about high-level states of mind, things like stress, fatigue, cognitive workload and focus. In 2019, a legendary neurohacker by the name of Christian Bayerlein reached out to me. He was actually one of our very first Kickstarter backers when we got started, early on. Christian was a very smart, intelligent, happy-go-lucky and easygoing guy. And so I worked up the courage to ask him, 'Hey, Christian, can we connect you to our sensors?' At which point he said, 'I thought you would never ask.' (Laughter) So after 20 minutes, we had him rigged up to a bunch of electrodes, and we provided him with four new inputs to a computer. Little digital buttons, that he could control voluntarily. This essentially doubled his number of inputs to a computer. Years later, after many setbacks due to COVID, we flew to Germany to work with Christian in person to implement the first prototype of what we're going to be demoing here today. Christian then spent months training with that prototype and sending his data across the Atlantic to us in Brooklyn from Germany and flying a virtual drone in our offices. The first thing that we did was scour Christian's body for residual motor function. We then connected electrodes to the four muscles that he had the most voluntary control over, and then we turned those muscles into digital buttons. We then applied some smart filtering and signal processing to adapt those buttons into something more like a slider or a digital potentiometer. After that, we turned those four sliders and mapped them to a new virtual joystick. Christian then combined that new joystick with the joystick that he uses with his lip to control his wheelchair, and with the two joysticks combined, Christian finally had control over all the manual controls of a drone. I’m going to stop talking about it, and we’re going to show you. Christian, welcome. (Applause) At this point, I'm going to ask everybody to turn off your Bluetooth and put your phones in airplane mode so that you don't get hit in the face with a drone. (Laughter) How are you feeling, Christian? Christian Bayerlein: Yeah, let's do it. Conor Russomanno: Awesome. This is a heads-up display that's showing all of Christian's biometric data, as well as some information about the drone. On the left here, we can see Christian's muscle data. Christian is now going to attempt to fly the drone. How are you feeling, Christian, feeling good? CB: Yes. CR: All right. Rock and roll. Let's take this up for a joyride. Whenever you're ready. CB: I'm ready. (Applause and cheers) CR: All right, take her up. And now let's do something we probably shouldn't do and fly it over the audience. (Laughter) (Cheers and applause) Alright, actually, let’s do this. I'm going to ask for people to call out some commands in the audience. So how about you? Straight forward. Straight forward. (Laughter) Alright. How about you? Man: Up! (Laughter) CR: Not down. Oh, he's doing what he wants right now. Amazing. (Cheers and applause) Alright, let’s bring it back. And what I'm going to do right now is take control of the controller so that you guys know that there isn't someone backstage flying this drone. All right, Christian, you're alright with that? CB: Yeah. CR: Unplug. Forward. And we're going to land this guy now. CB: I think I was better than you. (Laughter) (Applause) CR: Amazing. (Applause) Now I'm going to unplug it so it doesn't turn on on its own. Perfect. Christian has repurposed dormant muscles from around his body for extended and augmented interactivity. We have turned those muscles into a generic controller that in this case we've mapped into a drone, but what's really cool is that joystick can be applied to anything. Another thing that's really cool is that even in individuals who are not living with motor disabilities, there exist dozens of dormant muscles around the body that we can tap into for augmented and expanded control interactivity. And lastly, all the code related to that virtual joystick, we're going to open source so that you can implement it and improve upon it. There's three things that have stood out to me from working on this project and many others over the years. One, we cannot conflate the brain with the mind. In order to understand emotions and tensions and the mind overall, we have to measure data from all over the body, not just the brain. Two, open-source technology access and literacy is one way that we can combat the potential ethical challenges we face in introducing neural technology to society. But that's not enough. We have to do much, much more than that. It's very important, imperative, that we set up guardrails and design the future that we want to live in. Three. It's the courage and resilience of trailblazers like Christian who don't get bogged down by what they can't do, but instead strive to prove that the impossible is in fact possible. (Applause) And since none of this would have been possible without you, Christian, the stage is yours. CB: Yeah, hi, everybody. Audience: Hi. CB: I'm excited to be here today. I was born with a genetic condition that affects my mobility and requires me to have assistance. Despite my disability, I'm a very happy and fulfilled person. What truly holds me back are not my physical limitations. It's rather the barriers in the environment. I'm a tech nerd and political activist. I believe that technology can empower disabled people. It can help create a better, more inclusive and accessible world for everyone. This demonstration is a perfect example. We saw what's possible when cutting edge technology is combined with human curiosity and creativity. So let's build tools that empower people, applications that break down barriers and systems that unlock a world of possibilities. I think that's an idea worth spreading. Thank you.

That was after having spent about 20 years, together with African institutions, studying hunger in Africa. So I was sort of expected to know a little about the world. And I started, in our medical university, Karolinska Institute, an undergraduate course called Global Health. But when you get that opportunity, you get a little nervous. I thought, these students coming to us actually have the highest grade you can get in the Swedish college system, so I thought, maybe they know everything I'm going to teach them about. So I did a pretest when they came. And one of the questions from which I learned a lot was this one: 'Which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs?' And I put them together so that in each pair of countries, one has twice the child mortality of the other. And this means that it's much bigger, the difference, than the uncertainty of the data. I won't put you at a test here, but it's Turkey, which is highest there, Poland, Russia, Pakistan and South Africa. And these were the results of the Swedish students. I did it so I got the confidence interval, which is pretty narrow. And I got happy, of course -- a 1.8 right answer out of five possible. That means there was a place for a professor of international health and for my course. (Laughter) But one late night, when I was compiling the report, I really realized my discovery. I have shown that Swedish top students know, statistically, significantly less about the world than the chimpanzees. (Laughter) Because the chimpanzee would score half right if I gave them two bananas with Sri Lanka and Turkey. They would be right half of the cases. But the students are not there. The problem for me was not ignorance; it was preconceived ideas. I did also an unethical study of the professors of the Karolinska Institute, which hands out the Nobel Prize in Medicine, and they are on par with the chimpanzee there. (Laughter) This is where I realized that there was really a need to communicate, because the data of what's happening in the world and the child health of every country is very well aware. So we did this software, which displays it like this. Every bubble here is a country. This country over here is China. This is India. The size of the bubble is the population, and on this axis here, I put fertility rate. Because my students, what they said when they looked upon the world, and I asked them, 'What do you really think about the world?' Well, I first discovered that the textbook was Tintin, mainly. (Laughter) And they said, 'The world is still 'we' and 'them.' And 'we' is the Western world and 'them' is the Third World.' 'And what do you mean with 'Western world?'' I said. 'Well, that's long life and small family. And 'Third World' is short life and large family.' So this is what I could display here. I put fertility rate here -- number of children per woman: one, two, three, four, up to about eight children per woman. We have very good data since 1962, 1960, about, on the size of families in all countries. The error margin is narrow. Here, I put life expectancy at birth, from 30 years in some countries, up to about 70 years. And in 1962, there was really a group of countries here that were industrialized countries, and they had small families and long lives. And these were the developing countries. They had large families and they had relatively short lives. Now, what has happened since 1962? We want to see the change. Are the students right? It's still two types of countries? Or have these developing countries got smaller families and they live here? Or have they got longer lives and live up there? Let's see. We start the world, eh? This is all UN statistics that have been available. Here we go. Can you see there? It's China there, moving against better health there, improving there. All the green Latin American countries are moving towards smaller families. Your yellow ones here are the Arabic countries, and they get longer life, but not larger families. The Africans are the green here. They still remain here. This is India; Indonesia is moving on pretty fast. In the '80s here, you have Bangladesh still among the African countries. But now, Bangladesh -- it's a miracle that happens in the '80s -- the imams start to promote family planning, and they move up into that corner. And in the '90s, we have the terrible HIV epidemic that takes down the life expectancy of the African countries. And the rest of them all move up into the corner, where we have long lives and small family, and we have a completely new world. (Applause) (Applause ends) Let me make a comparison directly between the United States of America and Vietnam. 1964: America had small families and long life; Vietnam had large families and short lives. And this is what happens. The data during the war indicate that even with all the death, there was an improvement of life expectancy. By the end of the year, family planning started in Vietnam, and they went for smaller families. And the United States up there is getting longer life, keeping family size. And in the '80s now, they give up Communist planning and they go for market economy, and it moves faster even than social life. And today, we have in Vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size here in Vietnam, 2003, as in United States, 1974, by the end of the war. I think we all, if we don't look at the data, we underestimate the tremendous change in Asia, which was in social change before we saw the economic change. So let's move over to another way here in which we could display the distribution in the world of income. This is the world distribution of income of people. One dollar, 10 dollars or 100 dollars per day. There's no gap between rich and poor any longer. This is a myth. There's a little hump here. But there are people all the way. And if we look where the income ends up, this is 100 percent of the world's annual income. And the richest 20 percent, they take out of that about 74 percent. And the poorest 20 percent, they take about two percent. And this shows that the concept of developing countries is extremely doubtful. We think about aid, like these people here giving aid to these people here. But in the middle, we have most of the world population, and they have now 24 percent of the income. We heard it in other forms. And who are these? Where are the different countries? I can show you Africa. This is Africa. Ten percent of the world population, most in poverty. This is OECD -- the rich countries, the country club of the UN. And they are over here on this side. Quite an overlap between Africa and OECD. And this is Latin America. It has everything on this earth, from the poorest to the richest in Latin America. And on top of that, we can put East Europe, we can put East Asia, and we put South Asia. And what did it look like if we go back in time, to about 1970? Then, there was more of a hump. And most who lived in absolute poverty were Asians. The problem in the world was the poverty in Asia. And if I now let the world move forward, you will see that while population increases, there are hundreds of millions in Asia getting out of poverty, and some others getting into poverty, and this is the pattern we have today. And the best projection from the World Bank is that this will happen, and we will not have a divided world. We'll have most people in the middle. Of course it's a logarithmic scale here, but our concept of economy is growth with percent. We look upon it as a possibility of percentile increase. If I change this and take GDP per capita instead of family income, and I turn these individual data into regional data of gross domestic product, and I take the regions down here, the size of the bubble is still the population. And you have the OECD there, and you have sub-Saharan Africa there, and we take off the Arab states there, coming both from Africa and from Asia, and we put them separately, and we can expand this axis, and I can give it a new dimension here, by adding the social values there, child survival. Now I have money on that axis, and I have the possibility of children to survive there. In some countries, 99.7% of children survive to five years of age; others, only 70. And here, it seems, there is a gap between OECD, Latin America, East Europe, East Asia, Arab states, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The linearity is very strong between child survival and money. But let me split sub-Saharan Africa. Health is there and better health is up there. I can go here, and I can split sub-Saharan Africa into its countries. And when it bursts, the size of each country bubble is the size of the population. Sierra Leone down there, Mauritius is up there. Mauritius was the first country to get away with trade barriers, and they could sell their sugar, they could sell their textiles, on equal terms as the people in Europe and North America. There's a huge difference [within] Africa. And Ghana is here in the middle. In Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid. Here in Uganda, development aid. Here, time to invest; there, you can go for a holiday. There's tremendous variation within Africa, which we very often make that it's equal everything. I can split South Asia here. India's the big bubble in the middle. But there's a huge difference between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka. I can split Arab states. How are they? Same climate, same culture, same religion -- huge difference. Even between neighbors -- Yemen, civil war; United Arab Emirates, money, which was quite equally and well-used. Not as the myth is. And that includes all the children of the foreign workers who are in the country. Data is often better than you think. Many people say data is bad. There is an uncertainty margin, but we can see the difference here: Cambodia, Singapore. The differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data. East Europe: Soviet economy for a long time, but they come out after 10 years very, very differently. And there is Latin America. Today, we don't have to go to Cuba to find a healthy country in Latin America. Chile will have a lower child mortality than Cuba within some few years from now. Here, we have high-income countries in the OECD. And we get the whole pattern here of the world, which is more or less like this. And if we look at it, how the world looks, in 1960, it starts to move. This is Mao Zedong. He brought health to China. And then he died. And then Deng Xiaoping came and brought money to China, and brought them into the mainstream again. And we have seen how countries move in different directions like this, so it's sort of difficult to get an example country which shows the pattern of the world. But I would like to bring you back to about here, at 1960. I would like to compare South Korea, which is this one, with Brazil, which is this one. The label went away for me here. And I would like to compare Uganda, which is there. I can run it forward, like this. And you can see how South Korea is making a very, very fast advancement, whereas Brazil is much slower. And if we move back again, here, and we put trails on them, like this, you can see again that the speed of development is very, very different, and the countries are moving more or less at the same rate as money and health, but it seems you can move much faster if you are healthy first than if you are wealthy first. And to show that, you can put on the way of United Arab Emirates. They came from here, a mineral country. They cached all the oil; they got all the money; but health cannot be bought at the supermarket. You have to invest in health. You have to get kids into schooling. You have to train health staff. You have to educate the population. And Sheikh Zayed did that in a fairly good way. In spite of falling oil prices, he brought this country up here. So we've got a much more mainstream appearance of the world, where all countries tend to use their money better than they used it in the past. Now, this is, more or less, if you look at the average data of the countries -- they are like this. That's dangerous, to use average data, because there is such a lot of difference within countries. So if I go and look here, we can see that Uganda today is where South Korea was in 1960. If I split Uganda, there's quite a difference within Uganda. These are the quintiles of Uganda. The richest 20 percent of Ugandans are there. The poorest are down there. If I split South Africa, it's like this. And if I go down and look at Niger, where there was such a terrible famine [recently], it's like this. The 20 percent poorest of Niger is out here, and the 20 percent richest of South Africa is there, and yet we tend to discuss what solutions there should be in Africa. Everything in this world exists in Africa. And you can't discuss universal access to HIV [treatment] for that quintile up here with the same strategy as down here. The improvement of the world must be highly contextualized, and it's not relevant to have it on a regional level. We must be much more detailed. We find that students get very excited when they can use this. And even more, policy makers and the corporate sectors would like to see how the world is changing. Now, why doesn't this take place? Why are we not using the data we have? We have data in the United Nations, in the national statistical agencies and in universities and other nongovernmental organizations. Because the data is hidden down in the databases. And the public is there, and the internet is there, but we have still not used it effectively. All that information we saw changing in the world does not include publicly funded statistics. There are some web pages like this, you know, but they take some nourishment down from the databases, but people put prices on them, stupid passwords and boring statistics. (Laughter) And this won't work. (Applause) So what is needed? We have the databases. It's not a new database that you need. We have wonderful design tools and more and more are added up here. So we started a nonprofit venture linking data to design, we called 'Gapminder,' from the London Underground, where they warn you, 'Mind the gap.' So we thought Gapminder was appropriate. And we started to write software which could link the data like this. And it wasn't that difficult. It took some person years, and we have produced animations. You can take a data set and put it there. We are liberating UN data, some few UN organization. Some countries accept that their databases can go out on the world. But what we really need is, of course, a search function, a search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world. And what do we hear when we go around? I've done anthropology on the main statistical units. Everyone says, 'It's impossible. This can't be done. Our information is so peculiar in detail, so that cannot be searched as others can be searched. We cannot give the data free to the students, free to the entrepreneurs of the world.' But this is what we would like to see, isn't it? The publicly funded data is down here. And we would like flowers to grow out on the net. One of the crucial points is to make them searchable, and then people can use the different design tools to animate it there. And I have pretty good news for you. I have good news that the [current], new head of UN statistics doesn't say it's impossible. He only says, 'We can't do it.' (Laughter) And that's a quite clever guy, huh? (Laughter) So we can see a lot happening in data in the coming years. We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways. This is the income distribution of China, 1970. This is the income distribution of the United States, 1970. Almost no overlap. Almost no overlap. And what has happened? What has happened is this: that China is growing, it's not so equal any longer, and it's appearing here, overlooking the United States, almost like a ghost, isn't it? (Laughter) It's pretty scary. (Laughter) But I think it's very important to have all this information. We need really to see it. And instead of looking at this, I would like to end up by showing the internet users per 1,000. In this software, we access about 500 variables from all the countries quite easily. It takes some time to change for this, but on the axes, you can quite easily get any variable you would like to have. And the thing would be to get up the databases free, to get them searchable, and with a second click, to get them into the graphic formats, where you can instantly understand them. Now, statisticians don't like it, because they say that this will not show the reality; we have to have statistical, analytical methods. But this is hypothesis-generating. I end now with the world. There, the internet is coming. The number of internet users are going up like this. This is the GDP per capita. And it's a new technology coming in, but then amazingly, how well it fits to the economy of the countries. That's why the $100 computer will be so important. But it's a nice tendency. It's as if the world is flattening off, isn't it? These countries are lifting more than the economy, and it will be very interesting to follow this over the year, as I would like you to be able to do with all the publicly funded data. Thank you very much. (Applause)  \n",

How are you? (Audience) Good. It's been great, hasn't it? I've been blown away by the whole thing. In fact, I'm leaving. (Laughter) There have been three themes running through the conference, which are relevant to what I want to talk about. One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we've had and in all of the people here; just the variety of it and the range of it. The second is that it's put us in a place where we have no idea what's going to happen in terms of the future. No idea how this may play out. I have an interest in education. Actually, what I find is, everybody has an interest in education. Don't you? I find this very interesting. If you're at a dinner party, and you say you work in education -- actually, you're not often at dinner parties, frankly. (Laughter) If you work in education, you're not asked. (Laughter) And you're never asked back, curiously. That's strange to me. But if you are, and you say to somebody, you know, they say, 'What do you do?' and you say you work in education, you can see the blood run from their face. They're like, 'Oh my God. Why me?' (Laughter) 'My one night out all week.' (Laughter) But if you ask about their education, they pin you to the wall, because it's one of those things that goes deep with people, am I right? Like religion and money and other things. So I have a big interest in education, and I think we all do. We have a huge vested interest in it, partly because it's education that's meant to take us into this future that we can't grasp. If you think of it, children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065. Nobody has a clue, despite all the expertise that's been on parade for the past four days, what the world will look like in five years' time. And yet, we're meant to be educating them for it. So the unpredictability, I think, is extraordinary. And the third part of this is that we've all agreed, nonetheless, on the really extraordinary capacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation. I mean, Sirena last night was a marvel, wasn't she? Just seeing what she could do. And she's exceptional, but I think she's not, so to speak, exceptional in the whole of childhood. What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent. And my contention is, all kids have tremendous talents, and we squander them, pretty ruthlessly. So I want to talk about education, and I want to talk about creativity. My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it with the same status. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) That was it, by the way. Thank you very much. (Laughter) So, 15 minutes left. (Laughter) 'Well, I was born ... ' (Laughter) I heard a great story recently -- I love telling it -- of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson. She was six, and she was at the back, drawing, and the teacher said this girl hardly ever paid attention, and in this drawing lesson, she did. The teacher was fascinated. She went over to her, and she said, 'What are you drawing?' And the girl said, 'I'm drawing a picture of God.' And the teacher said, 'But nobody knows what God looks like.' And the girl said, 'They will in a minute.' (Laughter) When my son was four in England -- actually, he was four everywhere, to be honest. (Laughter) If we're being strict about it, wherever he went, he was four that year. He was in the Nativity play. Do you remember the story? (Laughter) No, it was big, it was a big story. Mel Gibson did the sequel, you may have seen it. (Laughter) 'Nativity II.' But James got the part of Joseph, which we were thrilled about. We considered this to be one of the lead parts. We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts: 'James Robinson IS Joseph!' (Laughter) He didn't have to speak, but you know the bit where the three kings come in? They come in bearing gifts, gold, frankincense and myrrh. This really happened. We were sitting there, and I think they just went out of sequence, because we talked to the little boy afterward and said, 'You OK with that?' They said, 'Yeah, why? Was that wrong?' They just switched. The three boys came in, four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads. They put these boxes down, and the first boy said, 'I bring you gold.' And the second boy said, 'I bring you myrrh.' And the third boy said, 'Frank sent this.' (Laughter) What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance. If they don't know, they'll have a go. Am I right? They're not frightened of being wrong. I don't mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative. What we do know is, if you're not prepared to be wrong, you'll never come up with anything original -- if you're not prepared to be wrong. And by the time they get to be adults, most kids have lost that capacity. They have become frightened of being wrong. And we run our companies like this. We stigmatize mistakes. And we're now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make. And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities. Picasso once said this, he said that all children are born artists. The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up. I believe this passionately, that we don't grow into creativity, we grow out of it. Or rather, we get educated out of it. So why is this? I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago. In fact, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles. So you can imagine what a seamless transition this was. (Laughter) Actually, we lived in a place called Snitterfield, just outside Stratford, which is where Shakespeare's father was born. Are you struck by a new thought? I was. You don't think of Shakespeare having a father, do you? Do you? Because you don't think of Shakespeare being a child, do you? Shakespeare being seven? I never thought of it. I mean, he was seven at some point. He was in somebody's English class, wasn't he? (Laughter) How annoying would that be? (Laughter) 'Must try harder.' (Laughter) Being sent to bed by his dad, to Shakespeare, 'Go to bed, now!' To William Shakespeare. 'And put the pencil down!' (Laughter) 'And stop speaking like that.' (Laughter) 'It's confusing everybody.' (Laughter) Anyway, we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles, and I just want to say a word about the transition. Actually, my son didn't want to come. I've got two kids; he's 21 now, my daughter's 16. He didn't want to come to Los Angeles. He loved it, but he had a girlfriend in England. This was the love of his life, Sarah. He'd known her for a month. (Laughter) Mind you, they'd had their fourth anniversary, because it's a long time when you're 16. He was really upset on the plane. He said, 'I'll never find another girl like Sarah.' And we were rather pleased about that, frankly -- (Laughter) because she was the main reason we were leaving the country. (Laughter) But something strikes you when you move to America and travel around the world: every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects. Every one. Doesn't matter where you go. You'd think it would be otherwise, but it isn't. At the top are mathematics and languages, then the humanities. At the bottom are the arts. Everywhere on earth. And in pretty much every system, too, there's a hierarchy within the arts. Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance. There isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance every day to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why? Why not? I think this is rather important. I think math is very important, but so is dance. Children dance all the time if they're allowed to, we all do. We all have bodies, don't we? Did I miss a meeting? (Laughter) Truthfully, what happens is, as children grow up, we start to educate them progressively from the waist up. And then we focus on their heads. And slightly to one side. If you were to visit education as an alien and say 'What's it for, public education?' I think you'd have to conclude, if you look at the output, who really succeeds by this, who does everything they should, who gets all the brownie points, who are the winners -- I think you'd have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors. Isn't it? They're the people who come out the top. And I used to be one, so there. (Laughter) And I like university professors, but, you know, we shouldn't hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement. They're just a form of life. Another form of life. But they're rather curious. And I say this out of affection for them: there's something curious about professors. In my experience -- not all of them, but typically -- they live in their heads. They live up there and slightly to one side. They're disembodied, you know, in a kind of literal way. They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads. (Laughter) Don't they? It's a way of getting their head to meetings. (Laughter) If you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences, by the way, get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics and pop into the discotheque on the final night. (Laughter) And there, you will see it. Grown men and women writhing uncontrollably, off the beat. (Laughter) Waiting until it ends, so they can go home and write a paper about it. (Laughter) Our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability. And there's a reason. Around the world, there were no public systems of education, really, before the 19th century. They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism. So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas. Number one, that the most useful subjects for work are at the top. So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid, things you liked, on the grounds you would never get a job doing that. Is that right? 'Don't do music, you're not going to be a musician; don't do art, you won't be an artist.' Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken. The whole world is engulfed in a revolution. And the second is academic ability, which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence, because the universities design the system in their image. If you think of it, the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance. And the consequence is that many highly talented, brilliant, creative people think they're not, because the thing they were good at at school wasn't valued, or was actually stigmatized. And I think we can't afford to go on that way. In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO, more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history. More people. And it's the combination of all the things we've talked about: technology and its transformational effect on work, and demography and the huge explosion in population. Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything. Isn't that true? When I was a student, if you had a degree, you had a job. If you didn't have a job, it's because you didn't want one. And I didn't want one, frankly. (Laughter) But now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games, because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA, and now you need a PhD for the other. It's a process of academic inflation. And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet. We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence. We know three things about intelligence. One, it's diverse. We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it. We think visually, we think in sound, we think kinesthetically. We think in abstract terms, we think in movement. Secondly, intelligence is dynamic. If you look at the interactions of a human brain, as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations, intelligence is wonderfully interactive. The brain isn't divided into compartments. In fact, creativity -- which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things. By the way, there's a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain, called the corpus callosum. It's thicker in women. Following off from Helen yesterday, this is probably why women are better at multitasking. Because you are, aren't you? There's a raft of research, but I know it from my personal life. If my wife is cooking a meal at home, which is not often ... thankfully. (Laughter) No, she's good at some things. But if she's cooking, she's dealing with people on the phone, she's talking to the kids, she's painting the ceiling -- (Laughter) she's doing open-heart surgery over here. If I'm cooking, the door is shut, the kids are out, the phone's on the hook, if she comes in, I get annoyed. I say, 'Terry, please, I'm trying to fry an egg in here.' (Laughter) 'Give me a break.' (Laughter) Actually, do you know that old philosophical thing, 'If a tree falls in a forest, and nobody hears it, did it happen?' Remember that old chestnut? I saw a great T-shirt recently, which said, 'If a man speaks his mind in a forest, and no woman hears him, is he still wrong?' (Laughter) And the third thing about intelligence is, it's distinct. I'm doing a new book at the moment called 'Epiphany,' which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent. I'm fascinated by how people got to be there. It's really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of, Gillian Lynne. Have you heard of her? Some have. She's a choreographer, and everybody knows her work. She did 'Cats' and 'Phantom of the Opera.' She's wonderful. I used to be on the board of The Royal Ballet, as you can see. (Laughter) Gillian and I had lunch one day. I said, 'How did you get to be a dancer?' It was interesting. When she was at school, she was really hopeless. And the school, in the '30s, wrote to her parents and said, 'We think Gillian has a learning disorder.' She couldn't concentrate; she was fidgeting. I think now they'd say she had ADHD. Wouldn't you? But this was the 1930s, and ADHD hadn't been invented at this point. It wasn't an available condition. (Laughter) People weren't aware they could have that. (Laughter) Anyway, she went to see this specialist. So, this oak-paneled room, and she was there with her mother, and she was led and sat on this chair at the end, and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes, while this man talked to her mother about all the problems Gillian was having at school, because she was disturbing people, her homework was always late, and so on. Little kid of eight. In the end, the doctor went and sat next to Gillian and said, 'I've listened to all these things your mother's told me. I need to speak to her privately. Wait here. We'll be back. We won't be very long,' and they went and left her. But as they went out of the room, he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk. And when they got out of the room, he said to her mother, 'Just stand and watch her.' And the minute they left the room, she was on her feet, moving to the music. And they watched for a few minutes, and he turned to her mother and said, 'Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn't sick. She's a dancer. Take her to a dance school.' I said, 'What happened?' She said, 'She did. I can't tell you how wonderful it was. We walked in this room, and it was full of people like me -- people who couldn't sit still, people who had to move to think.' Who had to move to think. They did ballet, they did tap, jazz; they did modern; they did contemporary. She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School. She became a soloist; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet. She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School, founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company, met Andrew Lloyd Webber. She's been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history, she's given pleasure to millions, and she's a multimillionaire. Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down. (Applause) What I think it comes to is this: Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson. I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology, one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity. Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth for a particular commodity. And for the future, it won't serve us. We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we're educating our children. There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk, who said, 'If all the insects were to disappear from the Earth, within 50 years, all life on Earth would end. If all human beings disappeared from the Earth, within 50 years, all forms of life would flourish.' And he's right. What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination. We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely, and that we avert some of the scenarios that we've talked about. And the only way we'll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are. And our task is to educate their whole being, so they can face this future. By the way -- we may not see this future, but they will. And our job is to help them make something of it. Thank you very much. (Applause)  \n",
       "5998                                                                                                                                                     If you're here today -- and I'm very happy that you are -- you've all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselves. However, when we're not at TED, we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible, especially in large urban areas like New York City. And that's because most people with decision-making powers, in both the public and the private sector, really don't feel as though they're in danger. The reason why I'm here today, in part, is because of a dog -- an abandoned puppy I found back in the rain, back in 1998. She turned out to be a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated. When she came into my life, we were fighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront despite the fact that our small part of New York City already handled more than 40 percent of the entire city's commercial waste: a sewage treatment pelletizing plant, a sewage sludge plant, four power plants, the world's largest food-distribution center, as well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each week. The area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city. So when I was contacted by the Parks Department about a $10,000 seed-grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects, I thought they were really well-meaning, but a bit naive. I'd lived in this area all my life, and you could not get to the river, because of all the lovely facilities that I mentioned earlier. Then, while jogging with my dog one morning, she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump. There were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won't mention here, but she kept dragging me, and lo and behold, at the end of that lot was the river. I knew that this forgotten little street-end, abandoned like the dog that brought me there, was worth saving. And I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community-led revitalization of the new South Bronx. And just like my new dog, it was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined. We garnered much support along the way, and the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park that the South Bronx had had in more than 60 years. We leveraged that $10,000 seed grant more than 300 times, into a $3 million park. And in the fall, I'm going to exchange marriage vows with my beloved. (Audience whistles) Thank you very much. (Applause) That's him pressing my buttons back there, which he does all the time. (Laughter) (Applause) But those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mine. We feel the problems right now, and have for some time. Environmental justice, for those of you who may not be familiar with the term, goes something like this: no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other. Unfortunately, race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff, like parks and trees, and where one might find the bad stuff, like power plants and waste facilities. As a black person in America, I am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health. I am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility, which I do. These land-use decisions created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity, diabetes and asthma. Why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood? Our 27 percent obesity rate is high even for this country, and diabetes comes with it. One out of four South Bronx children has asthma. Our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national average. These impacts are coming everyone's way. And we all pay dearly for solid waste costs, health problems associated with pollution and more odiously, the cost of imprisoning our young black and Latino men, who possess untold amounts of untapped potential. Fifty percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line; 25 percent of us are unemployed. Low-income citizens often use emergency-room visits as primary care. This comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits. Poor people are not only still poor, they are still unhealthy. Fortunately, there are many people like me who are striving for solutions that won't compromise the lives of low-income communities of color in the short term, and won't destroy us all in the long term. None of us want that, and we all have that in common. So what else do we have in common? Well, first of all, we're all incredibly good-looking. (Laughter) Graduated high school, college, post-graduate degrees, traveled to interesting places, didn't have kids in your early teens, financially stable, never been imprisoned. OK. Good. (Laughter) But, besides being a black woman, I am different from most of you in some other ways. I watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down. My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam, only to be gunned down a few blocks from our home. Jesus. I grew up with a crack house across the street. Yeah, I'm a poor black child from the ghetto. These things make me different from you. But the things we have in common set me apart from most of the people in my community, and I am in between these two worlds with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other. So how did things get so different for us? In the late '40s, my dad -- a Pullman porter, son of a slave -- bought a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx, and a few years later, he married my mom. At the time, the community was a mostly white, working-class neighborhood. My dad was not alone. And as others like him pursued their own version of the American dream, white flight became common in the South Bronx and in many cities around the country. Red-lining was used by banks, wherein certain sections of the city, including ours, were deemed off-limits to any sort of investment. Many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions -- dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding. Hunts Point was formerly a walk-to-work community, but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to. A national highway construction boom was added to our problems. In New York State, Robert Moses spearheaded an aggressive highway-expansion campaign. One of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan. The South Bronx, which lies in between, did not stand a chance. Residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were razed. 600,000 people were displaced. The common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx. And if you are told from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come from your community, that it's bad and ugly, how could it not reflect on you? So now, my family's property was worthless, save for that it was our home, and all we had. And luckily for me, that home and the love inside of it, along with help from teachers, mentors and friends along the way, was enough. Now, why is this story important? Because from a planning perspective, economic degradation begets environmental degradation, which begets social degradation. The disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come. Antiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood. Are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided? What costs are associated with these decisions? And who pays? Who profits? Does anything justify what the local community goes through? This was 'planning' -- in quotes -- that did not have our best interests in mind. Once we realized that, we decided it was time to do our own planning. That small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of building a Greenway movement in the South Bronx. I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade with dedicated on-street bike paths. Physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety, the placement of the waste and other facilities, which, if done properly, don't compromise a community's quality of life. They provide opportunities to be more physically active, as well as local economic development. Think bike shops, juice stands. We secured 20 million dollars to build first-phase projects. This is Lafayette Avenue -- and that's redesigned by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects. And once this path is constructed, it'll connect the South Bronx with more than 400 acres of Randall's Island Park. Right now we're separated by about 25 feet of water, but this link will change that. As we nurture the natural environment, its abundance will give us back even more. We run a project called the Bronx [Environmental] Stewardship Training, which provides job training in the fields of ecological restoration, so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these well-paying jobs. Little by little, we're seeding the area with green-collar jobs -- and with people that have both a financial and personal stake in their environment. The Sheridan Expressway is an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era, built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it. Even during rush hour, it goes virtually unused. The community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway. We have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to re-envision how this 28 acres can be better utilized for parkland, affordable housing and local economic development. We also built New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices. Cool roofs are highly-reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat, and pass it on to the building or atmosphere. Green roofs are soil and living plants. Both can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat, contribute to urban 'heat island' effect and degrade under the sun, which we in turn breathe. Green roofs also retain up to 75 percent of rainfall, so they reduce a city's need to fund costly end-of-pipe solutions -- which, incidentally, are often located in environmental justice communities like mine. And they provide habitats for our little friends! [Butterfly] (Laughter) So cool! Anyway, the demonstration project is a springboard for our own green roof installation business, bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx. [Green is the new black ...] (Laughter) (Applause) I like that, too. Anyway, I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here, but since I have all of your attention: We need investors. End of pitch. It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission. Anyway -- (Laughter) (Applause) OK. Katrina. Prior to Katrina, the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward had a lot in common. Both were largely populated by poor people of color, both hotbeds of cultural innovation: think hip-hop and jazz. Both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another. In the post-Katrina era, we have still more in common. We're at best ignored, and maligned and abused, at worst, by negligent regulatory agencies, pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability. Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable. But we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out. We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone. Now will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two, like the South Bronx did? Or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation in communities like mine? Now listen, I do not expect individuals, corporations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moral. This presentation today only represents some of what I've been through. Like a tiny little bit. You've no clue. But I'll tell you later, if you want to know. (Laughter) But -- I know it's the bottom line, or one's perception of it, that motivates people in the end. I'm interested in what I like to call the 'triple bottom line' that sustainable development can produce. Developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned: the developers, government and the community where these projects go up. At present, that's not happening in New York City. And we are operating with a comprehensive urban-planning deficit. A parade of government subsidies is going to propose big-box and stadium developments in the South Bronx, but there is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic, pollution, solid waste and the impacts on open space. And their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame it's not even funny. Because on top of that, the world's richest sports team is replacing the House That Ruth Built by destroying two well-loved community parks. Now, we'll have even less than that stat I told you about earlier. And although less than 25 percent of South Bronx residents own cars, these projects include thousands of new parking spaces, yet zip in terms of mass public transit. Now, what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy, environmentally-challenged community, versus incorporating structural, sustainable changes. My agency is working closely with Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issues. Now let's get this straight: I am not anti-development. Ours is a city, not a wilderness preserve. And I've embraced my inner capitalist. And, but I don't have -- (Laughter) You probably all have, and if you haven't, you need to. (Laughter) So I don't have a problem with developers making money. There's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable, community-friendly development can still make a fortune. Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins -- both heroes of mine by the way -- have shown that you can actually do that. I do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit. That it continues is a shame upon us all, because we are all responsible for the future that we create. But one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities, is to learn from visionaries in other cities. This is my version of globalization. Let's take Bogota. Poor, Latino, surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking; a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx. However, this city was blessed in the late 1990s with a highly-influential mayor named Enrique Peñalosa. He looked at the demographics. Few Bogotanos own cars, yet a huge portion of the city's resources was dedicated to serving them. If you're a mayor, you can do something about that. His administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three, outlawed parking on those streets, expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes, created public plazas, created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems in the entire world. For his brilliant efforts, he was nearly impeached. But as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day-to-day lives, incredible things happened. People stopped littering. Crime rates dropped, because the streets were alive with people. His administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time, and on a third-world budget, at that. We have no excuse in this country, I'm sorry. But the bottom line is: their people-first agenda was not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars, but rather, to provide opportunities for all Bogotanos to participate in the city's resurgence. That development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical idea here in the U.S. But Bogota's example has the power to change that. You, however, are blessed with the gift of influence. That's why you're here and why you value the information we exchange. Use your influence in support of comprehensive, sustainable change everywhere. Don't just talk about it at TED. This is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to build, and as you all know, politics are personal. Help me make green the new black. Help me make sustainability sexy. Make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations. Help me fight for environmental and economic justice. Support investments with a triple-bottom-line return. Help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table, and insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere. Oh good, glad I have a little more time! Listen -- when I spoke to Mr. Gore the other day after breakfast, I asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included in his new marketing strategy. His response was a grant program. I don't think he understood that I wasn't asking for funding. I was making him an offer. (Applause) What troubled me was that this top-down approach is still around. Now, don't get me wrong, we need money. (Laughter) But grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision-making process. Of the 90 percent of the energy that Mr. Gore reminded us that we waste every day, don't add wasting our energy, intelligence and hard-earned experience to that count. (Applause) I have come from so far to meet you like this. Please don't waste me. By working together, we can become one of those small, rapidly-growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world. We might have come to this conference from very, very different stations in life, but believe me, we all share one incredibly powerful thing. We have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Ciao, bellos! (Applause)  \n",
       "5999  (Music: 'The Sound of Silence,' Simon  and  Garfunkel) Hello voice mail, my old friend. (Laughter) I've called for tech support again. I ignored my boss's warning. I called on a Monday morning. Now it's evening, and my dinner first grew cold, and then grew mold. I'm still on hold. I'm listening to the sounds of silence. I don't think you understand. I think your phone lines are unmanned. I punched every touch tone I was told, but I've still spent 18 hours on hold. It's not enough your software crashed my Mac, and it constantly hangs and bombs -- it erased my ROMs! Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence. In my dreams I fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys. Say your motorcycle crashes. Blood comes gushing from your gashes. With your fading strength, you call 9-1-1 and you pray for a trained MD. But you get me. (Laughter) And you listen to the sounds of silence. (Music) (Applause) Thank you. Good evening and welcome to: 'Spot the TED Presenter Who Used to Be a Broadway Accompanist.' (Laughter) When I was offered the Times column six years ago, the deal was like this: you'll be sent the coolest, hottest, slickest new gadgets. Every week, it'll arrive at your door. You get to try them out, play with them, evaluate them until the novelty wears out, before you have to send them back, and you'll get paid for it. You can think about it, if you want. So, I've always been a technology nut, and I absolutely love it. The job, though, came with one small downside, and that is, they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column. And what I've noticed is -- first of all, you get an incredible amount of email. If you ever are feeling lonely, get a New York Times column, because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails. And the email I'm getting a lot today is about frustration. People are feeling like things -- Ok, I just had an alarm come up on my screen. Lucky you can't see it. People are feeling overwhelmed. They're feeling like it's too much technology, too fast. It may be good technology, but I feel like there's not enough of a support structure. There's not enough help. There's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use. One time I wrote a column about my efforts to reach Dell Technical Support, and within 12 hours, there were 700 messages from readers on the feedback boards on the Times website, from users saying, ''Me too, and here's my tale of woe.' I call it 'software rage.' And man, let me tell you, whoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will -- Oh, how did that get up there? Just kidding. (Laughter) Ok, so why is the problem accelerating? And part of the problem is, ironically, because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use. I'll show you what I mean. This is what the computer interface used to look like, DOS. Over the years, it's gotten easier to use. This is the original Mac operating system. Reagan was President. Madonna was still a brunette. And the entire operating system -- this is the good part -- the entire operating system fit in 211 k. You couldn't put the Mac OS X logo in 211 k! (Laughter) So the irony is, that as these things became easier to use, a less technical, broader audience was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time. I once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the Apple call center for a day. The guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to. And the calls that -- you know how they say, 'Your call may be recorded for quality assurance?' Uh-uh. Your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a CD. (Laughter) Which they do. (Laughter) And I have a copy. (Laughter) It's in your gift bag. No, no. With your voices on it! So, some of the stories are just so classic, and yet so understandable. A woman called Apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking. Making a squeaking noise. And the technician said, 'Well, ma'am, what do you mean your mouse is squeaking?' She says, 'All I can tell you is that it squeaks louder, the faster I move it across the screen.' (Laughter) And the technician's like, 'Ma'am, you've got the mouse up against the screen?' She goes, 'Well, the message said, 'Click here to continue.'' (Laughter) Well, if you like that one -- how much time have we got? Another one, a guy called -- this is absolutely true -- his computer had crashed, and he told the technician he couldn't restart it, no matter how many times he typed '11.' And the technician said, 'What? Why are you typing 11?' He said, 'The message says, 'Error Type 11.'' (Laughter) So, we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users. But why is the technical overload crisis, the complexity crisis, accelerating now? In the hardware world, it's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller, smaller, smaller. So the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier, but our fingers are essentially staying the same size. So it gets to be more and more of a challenge. Software is subject to another primal force: the mandate to release more and more versions. When you buy a piece of software, it's not like buying a vase or a candy bar, where you own it. It's more like joining a club, where you pay dues every year, and every year, they say, 'We've added more features, and we'll sell it to you for $99.' I know one guy who's spent $4,000 just on Photoshop over the years. And software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades. I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox -- which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times, you eventually ruin it. I mean, Microsoft Word was last just a word processor in, you know, the Eisenhower administration. (Laughter) But what's the alternative? Microsoft actually did this experiment. They said, 'Well, wait a minute. Everyone complains that we're adding so many features. Let's create a word processor that's just a word processor: Simple, pure; does not do web pages, is not a database.' And it came out, and it was called Microsoft Write. And none of you are nodding in acknowledgment, because it died. It tanked. No one ever bought it. I call this the Sport Utility Principle. People like to surround themselves with unnecessary power, right? They don't need the database and the website, but they're like, 'Well, I'll upgrade, because, I might, you know, I might need that someday.' So the problem is: as you add more features, where are they going to go? Where are you going to stick them? You only have so many design tools. You can do buttons, you can do sliders, pop-up menus, sub-menus. But if you're not careful about how you choose, you wind up with this. (Laughter) This is an un-retouched -- this is not a joke -- un-retouched photo of Microsoft Word, the copy that you have, with all the toolbars open. You've obviously never opened all the toolbars, but all you have to type in is this little, teeny window down here. (Laughter) And we've arrived at the age of interface matrices, where there are so many features and options, you have to do two dimensions, you know: a vertical and a horizontal. You guys all complain about how Microsoft Word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically. The off switch is in there somewhere. I'm telling you -- it's there. Part of the art of designing a simple, good interface, is knowing when to use which one of these features. So, here is the log-off dialogue box for Windows 2000. There are only four choices, so why are they in a pop-up menu? It's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices. They could have put them all out in view. Here's Apple's take on the exact same dialogue box. (Applause) Thank you -- yes, I designed the dialogue box. No, no. Already, we can see that Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design. Microsoft's approach to simplicity tends to be: let's break it down; let's just make it more steps. There are these 'wizards' everywhere. And you know, there's a new version of Windows coming out this fall. If they continue at this pace, there's absolutely no telling where they might wind up. [Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard] (Laughter) (Applause) 'Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard.' Ok, I'll bite. Let's click 'Next' to continue. (Laughter) (Applause) From the drop-down menu, choose the first letter you want to type. Ok. (Laughter) So there is a limit that we don't want to cross. So what is the answer? How do you pack in all these features in a simple, intelligent way? I believe in consistency, when possible, real-world equivalents, trash can folder, when possible, label things, mostly. But I beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all, which is intelligence. Now what do I mean by that? I'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent, but it's better. If you are buying something on the web, you're supposed to put in your address, and you're supposed to choose what country you're from, ok? There are 200 countries in the world. We like to think of the Internet as a global village. I'm sorry; it's not one yet. It's mainly like, the United States, Europe, and Japan. So why is 'United States' in the 'U's? (Laughter) You have to scroll, like, seven screensful to get to it. Now, it would be inconsistent to put 'United States' first, but it would be intelligent. This one's been touched on before, but why in God's name do you shut down a Windows PC by clicking a button called 'Start?' (Laughter) Here's another pet one of mine: you have a printer. Most of the time, you want to print one copy of your document, in page order, on that printer. So why in God's name do you see this every time you print? It's like a 747 shuttle cockpit. (Laughter) And one of the buttons at the bottom, you'll notice, is not 'Print.' (Laughter) (Applause) Now, I'm not saying that Apple is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity. Palm is also, especially in the old days, wonderful about this. I actually got to speak to Palm when they were flying high in the '90s, and after the talk, I met one of the employees. He says, 'Nice talk.' And I said, 'Thank you. What do you do here?' He said, 'I'm a tap counter.' I'm like, 'You're a what?' He goes, 'Well Jeff Hawkins, the CEO, says, 'If any task on the Palm Pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus, it's too long, and it has to be redesigned.' So I'm the tap counter.' So, I'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter. (Laughter) This is Microsoft Word. Ok, when you want to create a new blank document in Word -- it could happen. (Laughter) You go up to the 'File' menu and you choose 'New.' Now, what happens when you choose 'New?' Do you get a new blank document? You do not. On the opposite side of the monitor, a task bar appears, and somewhere in those links -- by the way, not at the top -- somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document. Ok, so that is a company not counting taps. You know, I don't want to just stand here and make fun of Microsoft ... Yes, I do. (Laughter) (Applause) The Bill Gates song! (Piano music) I've been a geek forever and I wrote the very first DOS. I put my software and IBM together; I got profit and they got the loss. (Laughter) I write the code that makes the whole world run. I'm getting royalties from everyone. Sometimes it's garbage, but the press is snowed. You buy the box; I'll sell the code. Every software company is doing Microsoft's R and D. You can't keep a good idea down these days. Even Windows is a hack. We're kind of based loosely on the Mac. So it's big, so it's slow. You've got nowhere to go. I'm not doing this for praise. I write the code that fits the world today. Big mediocrity in every way. We've entered planet domination mode. You'll have no choice; you'll buy my code. I am Bill Gates and I write the code. (Applause) But actually, I believe there are really two Microsofts. There's the old one, responsible for Windows and Office. They're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh, but they can't. They're locked in, because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis. But there's also a new Microsoft, that's really doing good, simple interface designs. I liked the Media Center PC. I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch. The Wireless Watch flopped miserably in the market, but it wasn't because it wasn't simply and beautifully designed. But let's put it this way: would you pay $10 a month to have a watch that has to be recharged every night like your cell phone, and stops working when you leave your area code? (Laughter) So, the signs might indicate that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse. So is there any hope? The screens are getting smaller, people are illuminating, putting manuals in the boxes, things are coming out at a faster pace. It's funny -- when Steve Jobs came back to Apple in 1997, after 12 years away, it was the MacWorld Expo -- he came to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans, and he sort of did this. The crowd went wild, but I had just seen -- I'm like, where have I seen this before? I had just seen the movie 'Evita' -- (Laughter) with Madonna, and I'm like, you know what? I've got to do one about Steve Jobs. (Music) It won't be easy. You'll think I'm strange. (Laughter) When I try to explain why I'm back, after telling the press Apple's future is black. You won't believe me. All that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a buddy named Woz. (Laughter) You try rhyming with garage! (Laughter) Don't cry for me, Cupertino. (Laughter) The truth is, I never left you. I know the ropes now, know what the tricks are. I made a fortune over at Pixar. (Laughter) Don't cry for me, Cupertino. I've still got the drive and vision. I still wear sandals in any weather. It's just that these days, they're Gucci leather. (Laughter) (Applause) Thank you. So Steve Jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty. And the truth is, for years I was a little depressed, because Americans obviously did not value it, because the Mac had three percent market share, Windows had 95 percent market share -- people did not think it was worth putting a price on it. So I was a little depressed. And then I heard Al Gore's talk, and I realized I didn't know the meaning of depressed. (Laughter) But it turns out I was wrong, right? Because the iPod came out, and it violated every bit of common wisdom. Other products cost less; other products had more features, they had voice recorders and FM transmitters. The other products were backed by Microsoft, with an open standard, not Apple's propriety standard. But the iPod won -- this is the one they wanted. The lesson was: simplicity sells. And there are signs that the industry is getting the message. This is a little company that's done very well with simplicity and elegance. The Sonos thing -- it's catching on. I've got just a couple examples. Physically, a really cool, elegant thinking coming along lately. When you have a digital camera, how do you get the pictures back to your computer? Well, you either haul around a USB cable, or you buy a card reader and haul that around. Either one, you're going to lose. What I do is, I take out the memory card, and I fold it in half, revealing USB contacts. I just stick it in the computer, offload the pictures, put it right back in the camera. I never have to lose anything. Here's another example. Chris, you're the source of all power. Will you be my power plug? Chris Anderson: Oh yeah. DP: Hold that and don't let go. You might've seen this, this is Apple's new laptop. This the power cord. It hooks on like this. And I'm sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives, or one of your children. You walk along -- and I'm about to pull this onto the floor. I don't care. It's a loaner. Here we go. Whoa! It's magnetic -- it doesn't pull the laptop onto the floor. (Applause) In my very last example -- I do a lot of my work using speech recognition software. And I'll just -- you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous. Speech recognition software is really great for doing emails very quickly; period. Like, I get hundreds of them a day; period. And it's not just what I dictate that it writes down; period. I also use this feature called voice macros; period. Correct 'dissuade.' Not 'just.' Ok, this is not an ideal situation, because it's getting the echo from the hall and stuff. The point is, I can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word, and having it write out a much longer thing. So if somebody sends me a fan letter, I'll say, 'Thanks for that.' [Thank you so much for taking the time to write ...] (Laughter) (Applause) And conversely, if somebody sends me hate mail -- which happens daily -- I say, 'Piss off.' (Laughter) [I admire your frankness ...] (Laughter) (Applause) So that's my dirty little secret. Don't tell anyone. (Laughter) So the point is -- this is a really interesting story. This is version eight of this software, and do you know what they put in version eight? No new features. It's never happened before in software! The company put no new features. They just said, 'We'll make this software work right.' Right? Because for years, people had bought this software, tried it out -- 95 percent accuracy was all they got, which means one in 20 words is wrong -- and they'd put it in their drawer. And the company got sick of that, so they said, 'This version, we're not going to do anything, but make sure it's darned accurate.' And so that's what they did. This cult of doing things right is starting to spread. So, my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology: remember, if it doesn't work, it's not necessarily you, ok? It could be the design of the thing you're using. Be aware in life of good design and bad design. And if you're among the people who create this stuff: Easy is hard. Pre-sweat the details for your audience. Count the taps. Remember, the hard part is not deciding what features to add, it's deciding what to leave out. And best of all, your motivation is: simplicity sells. CA: Bravo. DP: Thank you very much. CA: Hear, hear! (Applause)  \n",



                                                                                                                                                   Thank you so much, Chris. And it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice; I'm extremely grateful. I have been blown away by this conference, and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night. And I say that sincerely, partly because (Mock sob) I need that. (Laughter) Put yourselves in my position. (Laughter) I flew on Air Force Two for eight years. (Laughter) Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane! (Laughter) (Applause) I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me. (Laughter) It's a true story -- every bit of this is true. Soon after Tipper and I left the -- (Mock sob) White House -- (Laughter) we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville. Driving ourselves. (Laughter) I know it sounds like a little thing to you, but -- (Laughter) I looked in the rear-view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me. There was no motorcade back there. (Laughter) You've heard of phantom limb pain? (Laughter) This was a rented Ford Taurus. (Laughter) It was dinnertime, and we started looking for a place to eat. We were on I-40. We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee. We got off the exit, we found a Shoney's restaurant. Low-cost family restaurant chain, for those of you who don't know it. We went in and sat down at the booth, and the waitress came over, made a big commotion over Tipper. (Laughter) She took our order, and then went to the couple in the booth next to us, and she lowered her voice so much, I had to really strain to hear what she was saying. And she said 'Yes, that's former Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper.' And the man said, 'He's come down a long way, hasn't he?' (Laughter) (Applause) There's been kind of a series of epiphanies. (Laughter) The very next day, continuing the totally true story, I got on a G-V to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria, in the city of Lagos, on the topic of energy. And I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville. And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you: Tipper and I were driving ourselves, Shoney's, low-cost family restaurant chain, what the man said -- they laughed. I gave my speech, then went back out to the airport to fly back home. I fell asleep on the plane until, during the middle of the night, we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling. I woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air, and I looked, and there was a man running across the runway. And he was waving a piece of paper, and he was yelling, 'Call Washington! Call Washington!' And I thought to myself, in the middle of the night, in the middle of the Atlantic, what in the world could be wrong in Washington? Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things. (Laughter) But what it turned out to be, was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech, and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America. It was printed in Monterey, I checked. (Laughter) And the story began, 'Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday,' quote: 'My wife Tipper and I have opened a low-cost family restaurant'' -- (Laughter) ''named Shoney's, and we are running it ourselves.'' (Laughter) Before I could get back to U.S. soil, David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on -- one of them had me in a big white chef's hat, Tipper was saying, 'One more burger with fries!' (Laughter) Three days later, I got a nice, long, handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton, saying, 'Congratulations on the new restaurant, Al!' (Laughter) We like to celebrate each other's successes in life. (Laughter) I was going to talk about information ecology. But I was thinking that, since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED, that maybe I could talk about that another time. (Applause) Chris Anderson: It's a deal! (Applause) Al Gore: I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on: What can you do about the climate crisis? I want to start with a couple of -- I'm going to show some new images, and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five. Now, the slide show. I update the slide show every time I give it. I add new images, because I learn more about it every time I give it. It's like beach-combing, you know? Every time the tide comes in and out, you find some more shells. Just in the last two days, we got the new temperature records in January. This is just for the United States of America. Historical average for Januarys is 31 degrees; last month was 39.5 degrees. Now, I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment -- I'm kidding. But these are the recapitulation slides, and then I'm going to go into new material about what you can do. But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these. First of all, this is where we're projected to go with the U.S. contribution to global warming, under business as usual. Efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit. Efficiency and conservation -- it's not a cost; it's a profit. The sign is wrong. It's not negative; it's positive. These are investments that pay for themselves. But they are also very effective in deflecting our path. Cars and trucks -- I talked about that in the slideshow, but I want you to put it in perspective. It's an easy, visible target of concern -- and it should be -- but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. Cars and trucks are very significant, and we have the lowest standards in the world. And so we should address that. But it's part of the puzzle. Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks. Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference. And with what Vinod, and John Doerr and others, many of you here -- there are a lot of people directly involved in this -- this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it. Carbon Capture and Sequestration -- that's what CCS stands for -- is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe. Not quite there yet. OK. Now, what can you do? Reduce emissions in your home. Most of these expenditures are also profitable. Insulation, better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid. Use light rail. Figure out some of the other options that are much better. It's important. Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy, between things that have a harsh effect, or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis. Consider this: Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life. Those of you who are good at branding, I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people. It is easier than you think. It really is. A lot of us in here have made that decision, and it is really pretty easy. It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make, and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced. And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net. There is a carbon calculator. Participant Productions convened -- with my active involvement -- the leading software writers in the world, on this arcane science of carbon calculation, to construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculator. You can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are, and then you will be given options to reduce. And by the time the movie comes out in May, this will be updated to 2.0, and we will have click-through purchases of offsets. Next, consider making your business carbon-neutral. Again, some of us have done that, and it's not as hard as you think. Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations, whether you are from the technology, or entertainment, or design and architecture community. Invest sustainably. Majora mentioned this. Listen, if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance, don't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management. Over time, people do what you pay them to do. And if they judge how much they're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested, based on the short-term returns, you're going to get short-term decisions. A lot more to be said about that. Become a catalyst of change. Teach others, learn about it, talk about it. The movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago, except it's a lot more entertaining. And it comes out in May. Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it. Consider sending somebody to Nashville. Pick well. And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow -- re-purposed, with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach, and it's not just the slides, it's what they mean. And it's how they link together. And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse, in communities all across the country, and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week, to keep it right on the cutting edge. Working with Larry Lessig, it will be, somewhere in that process, posted with tools and limited-use copyrights, so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way. (Applause) Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm's length from politics? It doesn't mean that if you're a Republican, that I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat. We need Republicans as well. This used to be a bipartisan issue, and I know that in this group it really is. Become politically active. Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work. Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions -- global warming pollution -- and trading it. Here's why: as long as the United States is out of the world system, it's not a closed system. Once it becomes a closed system, with U.S. participation, then everybody who's on a board of directors -- how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation? Once it's a closed system, you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided. The market will work to solve this problem -- if we can accomplish this. Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring. We have to change the minds of the American people. Because presently, the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done. And in our modern country, the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did. It's now repetition of short, hot-button, 30-second, 28-second television ads. We have to buy a lot of those ads. Let's re-brand global warming, as many of you have suggested. I like 'climate crisis' instead of 'climate collapse,' but again, those of you who are good at branding, I need your help on this. Somebody said the test we're facing now, a scientist told me, is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination. (Laughter) That's really true. I said the other night, and I'll repeat now: this is not a political issue. Again, the Republicans here -- this shouldn't be partisan. You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do. This is an opportunity. Not just this, but connected to the ideas that are here, to bring more coherence to them. We are one. Thank you very much, I appreciate it. (Applause)  \n",
